I suppose it's called Cookie Clicker and not Idle Cookies for a reason. \n\nThe reason why is that progression in this game is extremely slow, especially at the start, unless you're constantly paying attention to it and clicking the golden cookies that appear every two minute or so on the screen. \n\nUnlike in many other similar games where you can sorta choose between the active and the passive route, in this one the only way to get any semblance of progress at all is through big combos, which, while they are quite satisfying when you pull them off, are almost entirely reliant on RNG, which can make for a very frustrating experience if you're not the gambling type.\n\nSo this game takes up a lot of your time and attention, but it's not like it offers anything riveting in return, and most of the time you'll just find yourself blankly staring at the screen waiting for something to happen, occasionally spamming your left click, and the rest of the time it'll be in the back of your mind, distracting you from your other activities, but not in a good way.\n\nThe fact that there isn't even any offline progress until you unlock it through the ascension mechanic, and even then it's only a pitiful fraction of what you'd make with the game open, that was the nail in the coffin. To me the whole point of this kind of game is that comforting feeling of having something running in the background, progressing without needing input, and never feeling obligated to check back on it but being happy to do so because I'll know I'll be rewarded for my patience. I didn't find that with this game. It was fun for a few hours, maybe from the nostalgia factor as I remember playing this on browser many years ago, but it got old pretty quick.\n\nAs for the fact this game isn't free-to-play unlike most clicker/idlers, that's actually one of the few positives for me, as in this case it means no tantalizing micro-transactions. Its price is very cheap anyways... However if you value your time, I'd stay away from this one as it'll eat up a lot more of it than it ought to.", "timestamp_created": 1643310242, "timestamp_updated": 1643310242, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, {"recommendationid": "108851536", "author": {"steamid": "76561199208180108", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 16155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 16155, "last_played": 1643248350}, "language": "english", "review": "don't", "timestamp_created": 1643248711, "timestamp_updated": 1643248711, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460076063871383667", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, {"recommendationid": "108499964", "author": {"steamid": "76561198830667244", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 118853, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7454, "playtime_at_review": 106519, "last_played": 1644654572}, "language": "english", "review": "this shit sucks", "timestamp_created": 1642814137, "timestamp_updated": 1642814137, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.453968226909637451", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, {"recommendationid": "108406699", "author": {"steamid": "76561199172015325", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 135, "last_played": 1637707872}, "language": "english", "review": "this is gameing that will be gay + Ration!!! \n\n\n\ni dont play it but okauy idk why i bought it \neeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeejnkjnkjnkjknkjkjnkjknkjnkjkjnkjnkjnkjnkjknnkjnkjkjnkjknkjknkjkkjjkkjneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPOOP", "timestamp_created": 1642705637, "timestamp_updated": 1642705637, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.349364787340164185", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, {"recommendationid": "108403494", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019496055", "num_games_owned": 216, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 5986, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1612, "playtime_at_review": 4461, "last_played": 1644686628}, "language": "english", "review": "meh. it really shows its age, i guess is what i would say. i had never played it but always heard how great it was. im sure it was years ago but there are better ones now imho. and it seems to slow my pretty newish computer down. at least way more than say adventure capitalist. \n\nnot like im gonna stop playing it and i suppose it was worth 5 bucks. but dont expect much.", "timestamp_created": 1642702044, "timestamp_updated": 1643776977, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487903237342834473", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, {"recommendationid": "108049920", "author": {"steamid": "76561199042005993", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 13745, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 13745, "last_played": 1634968337}, "language": "english", "review": "This is probably THE WORST game made in history.

The first is the technical issues, the second is the gameplay issues, so let's get into these.\n\nFirst off, I did NOT have issues with save files being deleted, instead I've had a number of other problems that aren't really unexpected. Cookie clicker was written in javascript, which doesn't really handle user interfaces at high framerates very well in general and never really has. This leads to lag in everything from cookie clicker to the secret world, so I had hoped that the steam port would have changed from javascript to C++ or python or something, but alas it has not. This means random interface lag spikes on a fairly frequent basis, to the point they actually interfere with gameplay.\n\nFor example, not only can you visibly see lag spikes when trying to click the cookie quickly, where it'll pause for half a second at a time ignoring all input in that time, where a stream of numbers has a clear gap, the freezing has made certain things like the chain-cookie be broken due to freezing and ignoring inputs on a 1-2 second window of opportunity for rare events. This is frustrating, but not game breaking.\n\nWhat is game breaking, however, is after I reached about the octillion range of cookies, the game stopped responding properly when tabbed out of it. If anything other than cookie clicker is the focus window, even with just like a text document partially obscuring the window but being the focus, cookie clicker slows down, then freezes entirely and it stops updating at all. it will sit there forever, without change, until you tab back into it. Several tests have confirmed that a golden cookie effect, such as the X7 frenzy, will sit there never going down, and you can time it for a minute, then tab back in, it'll jump ahead about 10 seconds quickly, then continue like nothing happened.\n\n...Yeah, an idle game which can't idle. You literally need to sit on the game at all times after a point to continue playing, rather than having it running in the background while you do other stuff. This completely defeats the entire purpose of an idle game, and for that reason alone, it would already be a negative review, but it doesn't end there.\n\nNow we get into the gameplay issues.\n\nEven if you have no technical issues with the game, the gameplay... well, cookie clicker was, to my knowledge, the very first idle game. It hasn't exactly aged well. Compared to other idle games, it requires an enormous amount of attention paid to the game, and progresses incredibly slowly.\n\nEven when you're just first starting the game, it takes a very long time to get it up and running properly, and you start hitting long progress walls very quickly.\n\nI first started cookie clicker this time because I was hit with the nasty flu going around this year, and couldn't concentrate on much anything other than an idle game for a few days. This meant spending basically 100% of my waking hours focused on cookie clicker actively, getting all the golden cookies and so on. It still took about 2.5 days for the first acension reset at 113 chips. For most other more modern games in the genre, this usually takes about 1-3 hours for the same effect.\n\nThe progression is... slow. Even with building up a large cookie store and doing the x7 +lucky cookie bonus (combo occurs roughly every 3.5 minutes if you're actively playing for about 220 minutes worth of production bonus), it still will produce almost nothing of real progression.\n\nThe one exception to this, is an odd spike where if you unlock the magic \"minigame\" and keep it stocked up in reserve, and wait for a x7 bonus, then also a x41 or so building multiplier, then trigger the magic effect to generate a new golden cookie with about a 25% chance to trigger a click frenzy X777 clicking bonus, you can increase your cookie total by a factor of about 1,000x where you would otherwise be reasonably able to attain. This doesn't really allow you to progress from that point, but it does let you unlock a lot of achievements and have more golden chips to spend when you do the ascension reset. Using this, in 4 resets I was able to get into the decillion range of cookies and ran into a new set of problems which is very bad... running out of stuff to do.\n\nI'm only a few days into the game and already the cursor building has run out of all upgrades. The last upgrade for it showed up at 450 cursors and I'm already up to 550 now. Grandmas are about to run dry, and looking at the upgrades which are available, it's clear that this is going to cause a real problem soon, because the scaling of the game is about for every 1,000x more cookies you get, your production goes up by about x60. This is falling off quickly as there are fewer upgrades to purchase, fewer achievements, and they don't scale infinitely, but rather every upgrade and achievement are individually crafted with amusing text descriptions, which is nice, keeps the game funny and enjoyable while they last, but unlike an infinite scaling setup it means they start running out fast too.\n\nIn short, the gameplay of the game is running out only a few days into the game. Yes, there are new things gradually opened up to unlock, but it's at the expense of previous, standardized things becoming defunct. Also, the newer gameplay elements take days at a time to be beneficial, built for extremely long play. The problem with this, as covered, is that the game is bizarrely active, and you're expected to click a golden cookie roughly every 90-110 seconds or suffer a huge loss in production and the game is balanced around the assumption you are doing this continually for days on end. You can't tab out properly as discussed earlier, and you can't really 'do' anything of value except wait for the next golden cookie to spawn every 1.5 to 2 minutes.\n\nSo... yeah. As an idle game, it's kind of really just not that good. It has a place in terms of history as being the first idle game, and if you're sick for a week it's an alright way to burn some time, but... as an idle game goes, it's too active to be idle, and the idle upgrades to make it possible to turn it off come in too late and are vastly inferior to playing actively to the point it's not really worth bothering with.\n\nIf you want an active idle game, go play Idle Wizard instead. I can't really recommend cookie clicker compared to the other free options out there when it just does the same thing as others but worse. It clearly has not kept up with newer innovations in the idle clicker genre.\n\nIf nothing else, the fact that it's still running on javascript alone should be good enough of a warning to stay away from it.", "timestamp_created": 1641600398, "timestamp_updated": 1641600398, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.577251255512237549", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, {"recommendationid": "107507648", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044795480", "num_games_owned": 242, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 8857, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 104, "playtime_at_review": 7179, "last_played": 1644294497}, "language": "english", "review": "Cookie Clicker was the first of its kind and the genre-definer, but the game doesn't hold up on its own. \n\nI know that it's a clicker, and I played it years ago before it came to Steam, but I just can't feel entertained enough to keep clicking or playing. Seeing numbers go up makes you feel excited, but as soon as you stall it feels really disheartening to be forced to leave your computer running all throughout the night just to make progress in the game.\n\nThere's many basic features that should be available from the very moment you start playing, but they are locked behind upgrades that you'll only be able to unlock after ascending. Some even after ascending multiple times, which takes way too much grind to achieve.\n\nThe market minigame feels kind of pointless, and getting more wizard towers to get more mana is also pointless because mana costs scale with the towers you own. You're expected to sell them in order to get another shot at it, but not telling the player how to do it at all feels like a problem, not to mention getting the quantity right. It's counter-intuitive to sell anything at all because you crimp your cookie production, even when you have buffs like the idol that boosts your production after selling buildings.\n\nThe music is nice, but design-wise the game is pretty bad.

Cookie Clicker is just kind of soul destroying to actually play (and I swear the progression curve is way less generous now which intensifies the issue by requiring longer play times to reach, e.g., the endgame grandmapocalypse, but I am not reinstalling to check the patch notes for balance changes or whatever because... no no that does not seem like a good idea for me). \n\nAnd that is kind of a big problem because we only have so much time on this Earth and I don't think clicking a picture of a cookie while continually monitoring a fictional stock market is a good way to spend it? \n\nOkay, you could say this point about pointlessness about pretty much any game, but Cookie Clicker is a game that wears the contradictions of video gaming on its sleeve (and so renders them particularly sharp) and while that does make it genuinely interesting from an artistic and satirical standpoint, it does still not make the actual experience of playing it good or healthy - indeed the feeling of compulsion I have to do something so openly and honestly pointless is probably actively unhealthy! (there's a reason I uninstalled after a few days!) - and I kind of have to base a recommendation of whether you should actually play this game on that.\n\ntl;dr As much as a game about massively overproducing cookies being bad for you is kind of fitting... it is still kind of bad for you so maybe don't play it? Like eating a ton of actual cookies might straight up be better for you (or at the very least less bad), in addition to being more enjoyable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.... ... ... ... ... Okay, also, as a petty point, I swear the performance I've experienced is less than ideal.
