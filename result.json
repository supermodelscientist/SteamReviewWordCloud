eggs, at room temperature     [*] 1 Tablespoon unsulphured or dark molasses     [*] 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract     [*] 3 cups (240g) old-fashioned whole rolled oats     [*] 1 and 3/4 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips   [/list] [hr][/hr]   [olist]     [*] Whisk the flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt together in a medium bowl. Set aside.     [*] In a large bowl using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium-high speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Add the brown sugar and granulated sugar and beat on medium-high speed until creamed, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs, molasses, and vanilla and beat on high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl and beat again as needed to combine.     [*] Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix on low until combined. With the mixer running on low speed, beat in the oats and both types of chocolate chips. Dough will be thick and sticky. Cover and chill the dough for at least 45 minutes in the refrigerator (and up to 4 days). If chilling for longer than a few hours, allow to sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before rolling and baking because the dough will be quite hard.     [*] Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (177\u00b0C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.     [*] Use a large cookie scoop to scoop the cookie dough, about 3 Tablespoons of dough per cookie, and place 4 inches apart on the baking sheets. Bake for 13-14 minutes or until lightly browned on the sides. The centers will look very soft.     [*]  Remove from the oven and allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

Cookie Clicker is an addiction. Based on my extensive naturalistic observation, I have seen how far a person can and will go in order to keep clicking cookies. This behaviour is very closely related to the behaviour of addicts, supporting my statement about Cookie Clicker being an addiction.  Cookie Clicker is the only thing on the effected person's mind. Even during the short periods where Cookie Clicker is not being played, the addicted individual will talk about Cookie Clicker any chance they get. Unfortunately, many people I know have faced this horrible addiction and I have seen how it takes over their minds. One time, while I was helping an addicted child overcome his problem, another addicted man came and stole the conversation from me turning it into a twisted talk of obsession. There was another time that really stood out in my mind about how Cookie Clicker is always on the effected individual's mind. I was in the car with two addicted individuals and was trying to have a normal, healthy, conversation with one. Sadly, the other person interrupted the conversation to talk about his cookies, and in doing so, he ruined a game that me and the other addicted person have been playing for years. That was truly a soul crushing moment for me.  As the addiction gets worse, the effected person will forgo any form of healthy social interaction to feed his addiction. There have been many times where I would try to enjoy some social time with a person who is addicted to Cookie Clicker, but they will always choose the game over real people. Sometimes, although it is rare, they will participate in social activity, but their thoughts are quickly consumed by cookies and it shows in their choice of conversation.  Like any addiction, the Cookie Clicker addiction is damaging to those who care for the addicted individual. The addiction will cause those who care for the effected person to feel guilty. The addicted person's family may feel responsible for that person's addiction. They will question how they have allowed them to develop an addiction, or perhaps they fought hard to help the addicted individual but were not able to help. Regardless of the circumstances, those who are close to the addicted individual will carry guilt and blame themselves to a certain extent.  As I mentioned earlier, I know people that are effected by this horrid game. I have seen others try to explain to them how damaging a simple game could be but they refuse to listen, and to some extent, those people blame themselves for not trying hard enough and letting them get sucked into this dark place. Another way it could affect those around the effected person is by them downplaying the problem. Like any addiction, people close to the person could just live in denial about the effected person's problem. They might make excuses for the person's behaviour or downplay the problem. They could also be scared about addressing the issue, worried about the possible future for the person, so they choose to ignore it instead of dealing with it.  At first I thought that this Cookie Clicker was a simple, although completely boring, game. Oh how wrong I was. The game slowly consumes the players, like a child eating cookies. I thought it was just going to be another game that people would quickly get bored of or forget about a few days later, and because of these thoughts, the Cookie Clicker addiction had time to fully manifest itself in their minds, since no one was trying to stop them. Another way it damages those around the addicted person, is that the addiction controls their mind. When people are addicted to something their whole life revolves around the addiction. It consumes their mind turning them into a different person, which is scary to those around them. Instead of the person seeing you as someone who cares for them, they will only see you as someone who is getting in the way of the only thing they care about, Cookie Clicker. You can try all you want to help the person get over this Cookie Clicker, but they won't see it that way. You could turn the computer off, but instead of the nice person you knew and cared for they will turn into some monster, screaming at you for making them lose their precious cookies. They are no longer the person you cared for.  Playing Cookie Clicker even just once is dangerous. Like any addictive thing, it may take only one time to become addicted. Cookie Clicker has just enough stuff for someone to keep on \"playing\" right from the beginning. At first you start with nothing, but as you continue clicking you gather enough cookies for upgrades, which make it so you can get more cookies faster, making you repeat an endless cycle of pain.  Cookie Clicker also has achievements for you to get, which keeps you hooked on the game. Not only does it have the upgrades that were mentioned earlier, but it also has achievements. Some of these achievement titles prove that the creators of the game are well aware that it's an addiction by having the achievement titles relate to drug use. One achievement is \"So baked right now\", another is \"Overdose\", and these sayings clearly show the relations to drug use.  Even if you manage to beat this addiction there is always the possibility of having a relapse. Unfortunately, no one I know has overcome this problem, but based on my knowledge of addictions, it's a very real possibility that they could suffer from a relapse. Relapses are a miserable part of addiction, even after you overcome the problem there is still a chance it could come back at any time. Possibly because of stress, negative emotions, really strong cravings, or being around things that remind you of Cookie Clicker. It is very damaging to your life and you might have to avoid cookies for the rest of your life unless you want to relapse. So you shouldn't play the game, even just once.  By now you should realize how dangerous this so called \"game\" is and the harmful effects it has on not only the player, but also those who care for the player. I truly hope that this paper will open people's eyes about this so called game, and that anyone who reads this won't let anyone they care for get sucked into this Cookie Clicker.", "Playing this makes me wish I was nice to my grandma before she was gone forever, idk why an idle game is making me regret things but yeah make sure you appreciate the people in your life who may or may not bake cookies sometimes.", "Its addicting. Fun to watch the numbers go up. That's every idle game. Cookie Clicker does it with a sense of style and humor that is completely lost on other idle games. That's what sets this title above the others. To see what clever pun or event happens as you go up. You think you know everything after a few hours but there are so many other layers. I played the browser version for several hundred hours and this is an improvement over that.", "Do not play", "There are enough satirical reviews, so I'll try to write something more robust. I played it for a long time in the browser and did not hesitate to grab this Steam version.  This is the king of idle games, in my opinion. Ironically, it's because the game can be pretty engaging if you're out to play actively and find interesting combinations in your never-ending goal to make more cookies. On the other hand, if you just want to leave it running, that's fine too. I'm sure the game provides a worthwhile critique of aggressive and near-nihilistic devotion to capitalist expansion, but I'm just going to focus on the gameplay for the time being...  You click the cookie to make cookies. Then you buy things that make cookies for you. Then you unlock upgrades that make even more cookies. Then you unlock minigames that allow you to make cookies while you make cookies. You make enough cookies to end the universe as we know it. But it doesn't end. It goes on, because you need to make more cookies.  If this sounds fun to you, you should try it out. The developer is and has been devoted to improving the game for years now, so we're likely getting more cookie production, more cookie minigames, and - ultimately - more cookies. An underrated aspect of the game is its flavourful aesthetic, news headlines, and Lovecraftian comedy (without spoiling too much).  With the variety of buildings, upgrades, and minigames, you can find the way you want to play. You can't really play the game 'incorrectly'. Do you want to just run it in the background and check in once a day to buy upgrades? Sure. Keep an eye on it to catch golden cookies? That works. Or try to run your minigames and spells in a way to chase incredibly large boosts of cookies in short bursts? You can do that too.  It doesn't matter, but it is fun. Just keep making cookies.", "click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click...click.....click.....click...click.....click....click.....click......click..click........click....click...click.click..click.....click.....click.....click......click.....click.....click.........click....click....click....click.....click.click...click......click.....click..click....click......click.....click.........click.....click....click...click......click....click.......click.....click.click.......click.....click......click....click......click..click..click......click....click..click.....click....click..click..click.click......click........click........click....click...........click.................click...................click................................click...................................click...............................click.............................................click..........................................click.......................................................click....................................................click...............................................................................click..............click..", "I didn't even buy this stupid game, my friend sent it to me.

The gameplay is straightforward and simple, you click cookies to buy upgrades and these upgrades will get you more cookies. This game's basic concept, however, will not deter any curious person from enjoying this game for many hours. Cookie Clicker has a unique charm to it that keeps its players hooked, that, which is best explained by experiencing it for oneself. For the price of $4.99, Cookie Clicker has kept me entertained for well over 100 hours of active play, though, the rest I did leave it idling. Throughout all my current 247 hours, I have yet to experience a single bug, which just shows how well polished the game is, a feature that I do not see too common these days. Cookie Clicker has been one of the best purchases I made on Steam, and I recommend this game to any person that is looking for something fun, and or to burn some time.", "Quit my job at Keebler to play this s h i t", "Now I can go back to when I was 16 and mindlessly click cookies again... But this time with steam achievements!!", "Cookie Clicker is a bizarre game and one that makes me wish that Steam had something better than a binary Yes/No review system, as this game can probably work well for some people but horribly for others. I have tried to keep this review as short as possible, but with enough depth to let you know whether this game could be for you.   The idea that idle games can form some sort of critique of modern games (especially with RPG elements increasingly commonplace) is well-worn and incredibly applicable to Cookie Clicker, and whilst some idle games have started charging for in-game purchases, Cookie Clicker is admirably devoid of them. The real question for someone approaching this is whether what Cookie Clicker does is subversive enough to warrant putting time into it at all.   [b]The Good-ish[/b] I wouldn't want to spoil what ends up happening in this game to anyone buying it and not really knowing what they are getting into, but the trailer on the Steam page and some of the screenshots already do that. This game's story and lore scale in a bizarre way that in its absurdity is incredibly compelling. The progression of buildings at a glance does an effective job at hinting towards this; whilst you start off buying cursors to click the cookie, you soon employ Grandma's to bake more cookies, farms to grow them, mines to them, banks to generate them from interest and much, much more including temples, wizards, alchemy and some fourth-wall breaking ironic inclusions. As the \"tech tree\" progresses, a news reel at the top of your window will start to report on the world of cookie clicker, and it is here than the real \"lore\" of the game comes out - it really is very well done; never are we given enough detail do build a coherent view of the world, but the specificity of the comments offer us unique yet contained viewpoints of the world. You could see this as looking upon a massive jigsaw through through many tiny and dispersed holes in a wall.   As the Steam page shows, at a certain point this game will bring an apocalypse,  cookie demons, and reincarnation. The absurdity is the game's biggest strength.  [b]The Bad-ish[/b] Whilst there are reasons like the short paragraph above to come to this game - there are caveats and certain things to be warned of going into it. The numbers go up in an amazing and rewarding way, but it is ultimately pointless. That wouldn't be an issue if it weren't for the golden cookies; these are cookies than spawn on screen, and when clicked, offer a buff to cookie production or a lump sum of cookies. If you are actively clicking those golden cookies, you can get hours worth of progress done in a few minutes - but given how the numbers go up and to no real end, you eventually do need to ask yourself why you want to click the golden cookies at all. I do not think that the game is a waste of mental energy at all; I quite enjoyed doing some mental arithmetic to work out which building would yield the most cookies per second (CpS) - and anything that gets you doing mental maths instead of just staring at YouTube is surely good. The problem really is in the golden cookie chase - I found it pretty easy to ignore them and only click them when I happened to be tabbed onto the screen, but at a certain point you unlock a sound cue for them; this is the really 'dangerous' part of the game. The sound cue is optional and can be toggled off; the problem is whether or not you have the willpower to do it. For a while I left it on assuming golden cookies were rare enough and valuable enough to be worth tabbing to the program and clicking - but as you get your ascension perks and with the right deities in place (as said prior, this game really does go places...) the rate at which golden cookies appear  gets overwhelming. If you have the self control to turn that sound cue off and not care about the golden cookies then this criticism will mean little to you; but there are definitely people for whom the sound cue will act as all too strong a distraction. That's important to me, for the following reason...  [b]So...?[/b] Ultimately, I have said \"Yes\" that I recommend this game. When we can take an ironic distance from the game and enjoy it for what it is, namely; a subversive idle game that reveals an absurd world through its progression and news reel, it is wonderful. But when we lose the ironic detachment from it and start to care about the golden cookies and the numbers going up, the game ceases to work in that subversive and absurdist way.   If you think you will care too much about the golden cookies and the numbers, I thoroughly recommend watching a breakdown video or reading some article going over the whole Cookie Clicker lore.

That said, there are three reasons you may want to plunk down $5 (or less if it's on discount) for this version: [olist] [*] Has a very pleasant/chill soundtrack (browser game just has beeps and bloops) [*] Steam Achievements (currently 500+; browser game just has in-game boring badges) [*] To give a little financial support if you've already played the game for a while [/olist]  [h1]Did It All For The Cookie[/h1] I gave the the browser version a shot not long after it first exploded in popularity (roughly Dec 2013) and was hooked. (According to Cookie Clicker my bakery started \"a long while ago\" because it didn't always track the start date.) Eventually I did far more idling than clicking, but I still let it run in a tab whenever my PC was on. Once a year or so there'd be a large update and I'd give it some extra focus. I'd also ascend 1-4 times per year out of boredom, to unlock Heavenly perks and increase my prestige, spending more time in it for a few days before letting it fall back to idler status.  And this game is [i]nearly[/i] a one-for-one replication of the browser game. (I wouldn't be surprised if it was running in some form of Chromium, in fact.) So while Cookie Clicker only released on Steam barely a day ago, I have 7+ years of experience with it. Is it a good game? Sure. You click the cookie to make cookies , buy things to click the cookie or create cookies on your behalf, unlock/buy upgrades, and a handful of micromanaging. \"Minigames\" such as a garden and stock market increase the gameplay variety. The achievements and their descriptions have amusing puns and references. A scrolling news ticker along the time can also offer a chuckle (oh, and unlocks.) There are business kittens and scary cookies.  But... it's still an idler game, so you get as much out of as the time you (don't) put into it. If it weren't for the browser version my recommendation would be to buy on heavy discount, though I don't think $5 standard price is bad for this (particularly with all the updates released since the initial 2013 launch.) Speaking of which, there are some fringe differences between this and the browser version: [list] [*][b]Heralds[/b] are now based on concurrent players (max 100) rather than the number of Patreon top pledges [*]The existing Achievements directly translate to [b]Steam Achievements[/b], currently 500+ available. If you're one of those who likes massive achievement numbers, here ya go. (But these are all legit achievements, not really achievement farming... I'll circle back to this) [*][b]Cloud saves[/b] mean no more lost games due to lost cookies/PC... but also means it's far harder to recover from a bad RNG. In the browser if I didn't like the result of a click, I could quickly hit F5 to reload (losing <60 seconds of progress and saving my bakery from the roll). With this you can still close the program, but the risk of an autosave occurring is larger and it's more of a hassle to get back into the game [*][b]Music[/b] has been added, giving a nice, chill soundtrack made by C418 (who did music for Minecraft.) I like it, but either I need to do something to unlock more tracks or there are only 3-4 tracks as I seem to already have plenty of repeats. You could consider this a $5 album with bonus idle clicker game, which I view as a legit way to think about it [/list]  At this point I'm uncertain I'll move to the Steam version to continue my bakery into year 8 (9?) or continue in the browser, but either way I don't regret the $5 spent. Plus, if I decide to stick with the browser I can take the progress I've made in the Steam version and import it there. Ah, that's right: You can export the data from your browser instance and import it into here. I did after first launching it and received 490 Steam achievements (taking about 10 minutes to go through the whole list). So for those who have already \"played\" Cookie Clicker for thousands of hours, the $5 might be worth it if you like Steam Achievement bragging rights.  One thing I should note regarding my recommendation is that for the past few months the browser version has been unreliable in loading. Once it loads there's no issue, but sometimes I have to refresh the page a few times to get that load to happen.

All I need now is ProgressQuest on Steam and my life will be complete.", "Really a great and classic clicker and idle game. Initially released in 2013, it is now out on steam with tons and tons of new feature and content. I remember playing this in my uni library way back in 2015 so playing this now gives me a nice nostalgia trip.  Though it does look the same as i remember with being familiar with all these different upgrades like the grandmas and such. There are some new things that are new which is cool to see. Gameplay wise is quite fun for a clicker game with there being a lot to do in terms of gaining an endless amount of cookies. Hundreds of upgrades, and a whole of of source of gaining them cookies and mini games to play making you come back for more and have that feeling of playing just a bit more for the time. It is is nice and satisfying to see the numbers build up with the clicks per second by clicking and idling.   Visually, it has a simple look to it with an accessible user interface which is easy to play with. All the content within looks great and is accompanied with some nice music to listen to as you click and idle. Price wise, it is quite cheap. I know that there is the free web version, but it is totally worth it to buy and have it on steam if you wish. From the game itself having a ton of content, making it deserved of the price to the features ingame as well as out of game. Having steam cloud is a really nice feature as i remember when i was playing it years back, I would play starting over from scratch from time to time, so having this feature is really nice for picking up and playing again even in the long future. There are hundreds of achievements with the steam achievements and it correlating with the achievements ingame with each having their own icon. Collecting them all, which would take a lot of time of course, adds to the playability and replayability as you try and collect as one as you keep on idling, clicking and playing.  With it just coming on steam, later on there apparently will be even more features like steam workshop. Am quite looking forward to how the game will develop even more. Overall, definitely worth it if you're into clickers and idle games, or have enjoyed playing the free web version in the past. It is a chill and casual game welcoming to all.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.  When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.  After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.  Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.  After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.  Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.  I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.  Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Play the stock market. Cause the apocalypse.", "TLDR: great game, but this version is buggy, clogs up your ram, interferes with other games running at the same time, and any new progress made in this version can't be transferred back to the browser version, so you're boxed in.  Update: The first patch is out, and it fixes 'the game will not let you close it' problem, as well as the memory leak (I think?  Not 100% on that) but the interface still bugs out sometimes, and it still borks controller support.  That controller thing is a really big deal, hope that gets fixed soon.  I want to preface this by saying I absolutely love this game, it's great, best idle game ever made, but the steam version is in pretty rough shape right now, and if you transfer your save to the steam version, you can't transfer any new progress back to the browser version because they have different version numbers, so you're kinda stuck with it.  Let me explain why that's an issue.  There are three key problems with the game at the moment: it's buggy, it has a memory leak, and it breaks controller support for any other games running at the same time.  The first problem is the most minor - nothing completely breaks, the interface just goes a bit wonky under certain circumstances, and, weirdly, the game will under no circumstances let you close it unless you kill the right process in the task manager.  Irritating, but not a big deal.  The second two problems are where the real issue lies.  This is a game that wants to be running at any time your computer is on.  Even with heavenly upgrades, the game punishes you for closing it with dramatically reduced CPS, so closing it should be avoided if at all possible.  This wasn't really an issue with the browser version, just leave your browser open and it'll chug along in the background, but this version has a small memory leak, so it will fill up a slowly-increasing volume of RAM over time, and, imo, much more seriously, the game breaks controller support in anything else that's running because it uses a javascript library that hijacks controller input.  If you want to play anything else with this game running in the background, you'd better hope it isn't a fighting game, racing game, or something else that wants to be played with a controller, or you'll need to close cookie clicker in order to use that controller.  I've been playing a lot of fighting games lately so when I realised this was an issue, I figured 'no big deal, I'll just take my progress back to the web version', only you can't - the steam version has a higher version number, so any progress you make in steam is bound to steam, until the web version is updated to the same version number.  I'm put in a weird position where I can only have this game running when I'm afk, or avoid playing the games I want to play in order to tiptoe around this game breaking controller support, and I can't just go back to the old version because I've made significant progress in this save that I don't want to lose.  At the end of the day, if you like the original, I think you should buy it, support the dev, but maybe wait on transferring your save to steam until these issues get ironed out.", "kanye west.", "considering i've literally been playing this game for over a quarter of my life it's about time i gave orteil some cash", "Ruin has come to my family...", "I don't get it.", "A very enjoyable, addictive game that offers a lot of progression. The game starts off slow, but don't be discouraged. Things will speed up and it feels rewarding as you progress.  The only negative aspect is the constant crashing, which is becoming incredibly frustrating. A windows error pops up saying the game has stopped responding. It can happen 5 times in a row when trying to open the game or randomly happen when the game is running. I've seen comments from others having the same issues and there is still no fix other than to open the game again, lose a little progress and hope it doesn't crash.

The only reason I'm writing this review is because I've just lost 1,207 hours worth of progress :)  After restarting my PC, the game, for some unknown reason, launched as a fresh, new game and promptly overwrote its own save.

Grease cookie sheets or line with parchment paper. Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt; set aside. In a medium bowl, cream together the melted butter, brown sugar and white sugar until well blended. Beat in the vanilla, egg, and egg yolk until light and creamy. Mix in the sifted ingredients until just blended. Stir in the chocolate chips by hand using a wooden spoon. Drop cookie dough 1/4 cup at a time onto the prepared cookie sheets. Cookies should be about 3 inches apart. Bake for 15 to 17 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the edges are lightly toasted.

However, the Steam version presents multiple very frustrating issues: Lost save data appears to be a common issue, and due to its nature as an idle game this can mean hours of time lost. Why this would be released with an utterly broken save feature is beyond me, but in the meantime all I can suggest is manually exporting/importing saves as necessary .... I also have issues with the game frequently crashing either on startup or shortly after, and often requiring use of Task Manager to properly close the game after it crashes.

Pollution and radiation render the planet uninhabitable to all but the most resilient microbes and bacterium.   3,000 years later, a small team of cosmic archaeologists depart from a distant solar system to explore the remnants of human civilization, tasked with understanding how and why our civilization faltered. Despite the breadth of our history and culture, there is little to be found amongst the detritus, and our visitors begin to wonder if perhaps these ruins are the only evidence we existed at all.   After days of rummaging through ash and detritus, the explorers stumble upon a lone building, still standing amongst the devastation. It is in remarkably good condition, given the circumstances. After running a quick analysis with their scanners, the cosmonauts discover that the building is somehow still generating and consuming electricity. As they move in to investigate, they find something beyond belief:    A single computer still running Cookie Clicker. The last remnant of human civilization.   Suddenly, it all makes sense.

And whenever it crashes, it always seems to leave behind a stray electron process that I have to manually kill before steam thinks the program is actually dead and I can restart it.

Gameplay:  The gameplay goals are relatively simple. More cookies\u2026make more cookies! You start with an empty glass and no milk or cookies. Each click gives you a cookie, a process I wish was true of real life. Eventually, you will click your way to your first upgraded idle clicker. The more cookies you can stock up on the more upgrades you can purchase from the store. Before you know it, you will have ascended that solum 1 cookie per click to farms, baking you thousands if not millions within a reasonably short amount of time. You can also invest your cookies into power-ups. Such as your cookie farm becoming twice as effective or an increased percentage per click.  As you continue to build your cookie balance you can buy more and more upgrades increasing your idle cookies per second. Once you eventually get to the next available balance milestone you will unlock the next upgradeable. Some of the earlier upgrades consist of; Grandma, Farm, Mine, and factory. The rest, you will have to find out for yourself.  There is also a Legacy section where you will be set a goal, the first being to bake a trillion cookies. Once you have hit this milestone you can then prestige if you wish or continue to gain levels by baking more cookies to spend more points on permanent upgrades. This will set you back to the very start of your journey but with powerful and permanent boosters to aid you. While playing make sure to keep an eye out for the golden cookies! Once activated these provide a powerful temporary boost such as a frenzy mode doubling your cookie production, or maybe you will receive a large injection of extra cookies to top up your balance.  There are also Sugar lumps. This is shown next to your cookie balance and takes a very long time to build/ mature. Once you have collected your sugar lump you can use this to level up your upgrades. Level 0 grants +0% CPS and each level after grants an increase to your CPS. Some buildings can give special perks such as temples allowing you to choose pantheons to give buffs to various attributes of the game, or wizard towers which give you access to powerful spells with a 15% chance of a backfire and a negative effect, or even upgrading the bank allowing you to access an in game stock market. Truly amazing.   Story:  Surprisingly the story in cookie clicker is vast and engaging with natural passing and unexpected turns. the story follows a simple concept of you the player opening a cookie store and expanding your baking empire. You will learn to increase production by taking advantage of investment opportunities by buying upgrades and buildings starting from the humble grandmas and eventually investing in full blown time machines and antimatter condensers. Unfortunately, things take a turn for you the young capitalist when you upgrade grandmas for means of production in complete negligence to all ethics, exploiting slave labour you use your power force hundreds of grandmas to work in these buildings including gruelling tasks on the farm and digging in the mines as the world around you bends towards your will creating an economy based on cookies while controlling a monopoly on all cookie suppliers. The news feed will attempt to warn you of these heinous deeds to insist to commit while you ignore every word and watch the cookies roll in. While keeping them grandmas cooped up in a retirement home they hatch an evil plan while communing with the demons beyond portals to gain their powers and take over the world as a rise of freedom from your oppression, sending worms to hijack your production and turning golden cookies into wrath cookies with chances of negative effects. The portrayal of capitalism and working party embargo creates remarkable depiction of what society could be like given the opportunity of extreme capitalism going out of hand without hindering the game experience to make these political undertones a hindrance by shoving propaganda disguised as a game in your face. Overall very impressive and inspiring.   Graphics and Audio:  Graphically the game isn\u2019t very intense. It is, however very pleasing, even more so on the upgraded graphics given by steam. There are a number of small animations such as the moving background and the movement of the milk in the glass as well as a tabloid news feed hinting at potential foreshadowing of the story as well as flavour text which keep your attention well however aren't too distracting at the same time. The audio was very nice. The in-game music is soothing and relaxing thanks to the help of the fantastic work of c418 while little audio cues keep you aware of what is happening with a satisfying click keeps you engaged. There are also a lot of customisation options available in-game to tailor the experience to your own requirements.  the graphics develop drastically as you progress through the story, in the beginning as you just open a new corner side local cookie shop the graphics reflect that with pleasing to the eye blue and light blue vertical stripes with an extremely wholesome feel. As you progress and earn more you start to notice small cookies raining in the glass increasing exponentially. During the grandmapocalypse, an in-game event that begins after a long chain of upgrades these graphic changes become less subtle as the before wholesome cookie shop walls slowly turns into a dystopian love-craftion horror depiction of the harsh reality of capitalism within todays society with large flesh amorthic grandma blobs and horrific parasites that eat away at your cookie production. Luckily for the more faint hearted of you, the game has implemented an option that makes all these horrific changes redundant and gives the parasites googly eyes.   Longevity:  The Longevity of the game could be somewhat questionable. While it is not likely to be a game that you will be itching to play daily. It is a great game for relaxing or multitasking. If you enjoy a challenge there is over 600+ Upgrades and over 500+ achievements to work towards including many secrets and easter eggs in the form as shadow achievements. Including minigames such as growing farms and investing in stocks its unlikely for you to grow bored any time soon, and should the time arise where you have nothing left to do, leave the game running come back later and enjoy the fruits of your afk labour by investing a large sum of generated cookies you so rightfully earned. It is likely you may find yourself with hundreds of hours in the game however due to the nature of afk games the actual playtime can be left somewhat debated.   Conclusion:  Overall, I really enjoy the experience I receive playing Cookie Clicker. I found it peaceful and relaxing at night but also laid back enough to play while watching TV/ YouTube. I\u2019ve also heard that it could be a great option for those long meetings at work if you\u2019re still working from home. With the expansive story and ludicrous amounts of achievements and goals to achieve, I can\u2019t see myself putting down the game anytime soon. With full modding support from the steam workshop to come and more updates up the developers sleeves I am optimistic in cookie clickers future.   Overall, I would rate cookie clicker a solid,  who gives a fuck? why are you even reading this shitty review / 10 ", "click the cookie get more cookies click the cookie get more cookies click the cookie get more cookies click the cookie summon an apocalypse click the cookie get more cookies", "I played it enough to form an actual opinion, and I've decided that this game just isn't for me", "Yeah musics cool... get a autoclicker for your own anus's sake.", "I have severe autism", "HAHA YES COOKIE", "This game remind us to cherish our Grandma because they will for ever encourage us to all of us plan, even the more ridiculous.

It also is the origin of the Idle Game and Clicker Game genres.", "You click cookie, you get cookie...  You click cookie, you get cookie...  You click cookie, you get cookie...  You click cookie, you get cookie...  You click cookie, you get cookie...  You click cookie, you get cookie...", "There are two main categories for why this isn't recommended. The first is the technical issues, the second is the gameplay issues, so let's get into these.  First off, I did NOT have issues with save files being deleted, instead I've had a number of other problems that aren't really unexpected. Cookie clicker was written in javascript, which doesn't really handle user interfaces at high framerates very well in general and never really has. This leads to lag in everything from cookie clicker to the secret world, so I had hoped that the steam port would have changed from javascript to C++ or python or something, but alas it has not. This means random interface lag spikes on a fairly frequent basis, to the point they actually interfere with gameplay.  For example, not only can you visibly see lag spikes when trying to click the cookie quickly, where it'll pause for half a second at a time ignoring all input in that time, where a stream of numbers has a clear gap, the freezing has made certain things like the chain-cookie be broken due to freezing and ignoring inputs on a 1-2 second window of opportunity for rare events. This is frustrating, but not game breaking.  What is game breaking, however, is after I reached about the octillion range of cookies, the game stopped responding properly when tabbed out of it. If anything other than cookie clicker is the focus window, even with just like a text document partially obscuring the window but being the focus, cookie clicker slows down, then freezes entirely and it stops updating at all. it will sit there forever, without change, until you tab back into it. Several tests have confirmed that a golden cookie effect, such as the X7 frenzy, will sit there never going down, and you can time it for a minute, then tab back in, it'll jump ahead about 10 seconds quickly, then continue like nothing happened.  ...Yeah, an idle game which can't idle. You literally need to sit on the game at all times after a point to continue playing, rather than having it running in the background while you do other stuff. This completely defeats the entire purpose of an idle game, and for that reason alone, it would already be a negative review, but it doesn't end there.  Now we get into the gameplay issues.  Even if you have no technical issues with the game, the gameplay... well, cookie clicker was, to my knowledge, the very first idle game. It hasn't exactly aged well. Compared to other idle games, it requires an enormous amount of attention paid to the game, and progresses incredibly slowly.  Even when you're just first starting the game, it takes a very long time to get it up and running properly, and you start hitting long progress walls very quickly.  I first started cookie clicker this time because I was hit with the nasty flu going around this year, and couldn't concentrate on much anything other than an idle game for a few days. This meant spending basically 100% of my waking hours focused on cookie clicker actively, getting all the golden cookies and so on. It still took about 2.5 days for the first acension reset at 113 chips. For most other more modern games in the genre, this usually takes about 1-3 hours for the same effect.  The progression is... slow. Even with building up a large cookie store and doing the x7 +lucky cookie bonus (combo occurs roughly every 3.5 minutes if you're actively playing for about 220 minutes worth of production bonus), it still will produce almost nothing of real progression.  The one exception to this, is an odd spike where if you unlock the magic \"minigame\" and keep it stocked up in reserve, and wait for a x7 bonus, then also a x41 or so building multiplier, then trigger the magic effect to generate a new golden cookie with about a 25% chance to trigger a click frenzy X777 clicking bonus, you can increase your cookie total by a factor of about 1,000x where you would otherwise be reasonably able to attain. This doesn't really allow you to progress from that point, but it does let you unlock a lot of achievements and have more golden chips to spend when you do the ascension reset. Using this, in 4 resets I was able to get into the decillion range of cookies and ran into a new set of problems which is very bad... running out of stuff to do.  I'm only a few days into the game and already the cursor building has run out of all upgrades. The last upgrade for it showed up at 450 cursors and I'm already up to 550 now. Grandmas are about to run dry, and looking at the upgrades which are available, it's clear that this is going to cause a real problem soon, because the scaling of the game is about for every 1,000x more cookies you get, your production goes up by about x60. This is falling off quickly as there are fewer upgrades to purchase, fewer achievements, and they don't scale infinitely, but rather every upgrade and achievement are individually crafted with amusing text descriptions, which is nice, keeps the game funny and enjoyable while they last, but unlike an infinite scaling setup it means they start running out fast too.  In short, the gameplay of the game is running out only a few days into the game. Yes, there are new things gradually opened up to unlock, but it's at the expense of previous, standardized things becoming defunct. Also, the newer gameplay elements take days at a time to be beneficial, built for extremely long play. The problem with this, as covered, is that the game is bizarrely active, and you're expected to click a golden cookie roughly every 90-110 seconds or suffer a huge loss in production and the game is balanced around the assumption you are doing this continually for days on end. You can't tab out properly as discussed earlier, and you can't really 'do' anything of value except wait for the next golden cookie to spawn every 1.5 to 2 minutes.  So... yeah. As an idle game, it's kind of really just not that good. It has a place in terms of history as being the first idle game, and if you're sick for a week it's an alright way to burn some time, but... as an idle game goes, it's too active to be idle, and the idle upgrades to make it possible to turn it off come in too late and are vastly inferior to playing actively to the point it's not really worth bothering with.  If you want an active idle game, go play Idle Wizard instead. I can't really recommend cookie clicker compared to the other free options out there when it just does the same thing as others but worse. It clearly has not kept up with newer innovations in the idle clicker genre.  If nothing else, the fact that it's still running on javascript alone should be good enough of a warning to stay away from it.", "pretend the like button is the cookie can we get 100 likes?", "2.5hrs in and my game crashed and lost all my save already ... so much for cloud saving now i lost everythin", "oooooooooooooooh you wanna click those cookies soooooo bad oooooooooooooh", "COOK E", "The first achievement spam game on Steam that isn't a malware or a hentai puzzle game.", "First leaf blower sim and now this....", "Click", "I used to be a cookie clicker addict, but I had been clean for years.

Grease cookie sheets or line with parchment paper. Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt; set aside. In a medium bowl, cream together the melted butter, brown sugar and white sugar until well blended. Beat in the vanilla, egg, and egg yolk until light and creamy. Mix in the sifted ingredients until just blended. Stir in the chocolate chips by hand using a wooden spoon. Drop cookie dough 1/4 cup at a time onto the prepared cookie sheets. Cookies should be about 3 inches apart. Bake for 15 to 17 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the edges are lightly toasted.

There is plenty of cool upgrades/ boosts, including basically like (rebirths that can benefit you more as you go on. The game also makes you capable to leave the game open on your screen or run in the background and keep the grind going. As said the game offers CPS and plenty of upgrades, with that benefit you can also have the privilege to idle grind and get very far especially if you're a busy camper and have to do other things at times aside from sitting playing a game. You could for example want to do some work related stuff well you can! You can keep it going on your screen and get them cookies! :)!

Grease cookie sheets or line with parchment paper. Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt; set aside. In a medium bowl, cream together the melted butter, brown sugar and white sugar until well blended. Beat in the vanilla, egg, and egg yolk until light and creamy. Mix in the sifted ingredients until just blended. Stir in the chocolate chips by hand using a wooden spoon. Drop cookie dough 1/4 cup at a time onto the prepared cookie sheets. Cookies should be about 3 inches apart. Bake for 15 to 17 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the edges are lightly toasted. Cool on baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring to wire rack.\ufeff  Or at least, that's what they tell you. You see, for years I have been trying to perfect my cookie business. After graduating a prestigious university with a degree in baking, I spent the next fifteen years of my life attempting to perfect the cookie formula. For hours on end I would try hundreds of different cookie recipes, hoping to find the one that satisfied my needs. Whenever a kid on the block was selling cookies, I would run over their pitiful stand with my car when they took a bathroom break. I cannot let any competitors attempt to coerce my potential customers with their youthful presence. Some say this may not be morally correct, I disagree. This business is ruthless, and the way I see it I'm toughening these kids up. If they think they can leave their entire base of operations unattended for any amount of time, well they are sorely mistaken. But now I'm getting off topic.  So here I was, destroying my competitors and researching the perfect combination of ingredients for my cookie recipe. I had started to befriend my neighbors grandma's, in order to research them. You see, grandmas seem to have a special connection to the cookie world, and I wanted to use that. If I could not become them, I would just have to use them to strengthen my own recipe. Slowly, I had become acquainted with hundreds, if not thousands of different grandmothers. I started renting out garages, inviting them in masses to bake cookies for hours under the ploy of \"baking for the homeless\". This lead the business to gain some notoriety overtime, and the profits began to grow. But it still wasn't enough. You see, even after extracting many formulas from the elderly, it still didn't seem to be good enough for me. Yes, that was the best year we have had financially, but I couldn't help but feel like something was missing.  And so I stopped focusing on the business, and spent my time in search of more recipes to try. This was when I met Guillermo. Guillermo was a famous baker from italy, who I happened to meet during one of my many travels across the world in search of the chosen one. When I had first tried one of his cookies, I couldn't believe what I had just bitten into. It was the most magnificent thing I had ever placed my taste buds on. Right at that very moment, I knew he had to be the one.  And so, I made sweet love to him that very night. And then we made sweet love the next night. And the night after that. I made him fall madly in love with me, and offered to take him back to the US with me, where my business was still awaiting me. We returned to the factory, and I immediately locked him in a cage and sent him back to work. Our cookies finally became world renowned, known as the most delicious pastry to ever be offered. I was on top of the world. I spent the next few months going on talk shows, meeting with important political figures, and engaging in some hardcore drugs.  The only problem was that we needed Guillermo to add the special final touch to every cookie we packaged, as he was the only one capable of producing the perfect cookie. This did make mass production harder, yes, but the sense of scarcity only made our cookies all the more expensive. But one day, as one of my associates came down to deliver Guillermo his daily meal of beans on bread, we had discovered that he smashed the mirror in his room and used the shards to slash his wrists. He was dead on site. Normally this wouldn't be any of my concern as it was a common occurrence in many of our facilities, but the death of our beloved Guillermo meant that the quality of our cookies would be directly impacted. To make matters worse, the authorities had begun to catch on to our practices.  Apparently Guillermo came from a very rich family, and they had hired a private investigator to track his whereabouts. This ultimately lead them to infiltrate our main factory, where they captured footage of our workers and released the information to the press. The world was too blind to see that there had to be some sacrifices in order to achieve prosperity. They were too foolish to understand that without me, their lives would be meaningless. It did not matter though. In the coming hours, our campus had been breached and many of our workers had been freed. And there I was, barricaded in my office all alone. It gave me time to ponder everything... Did I regret everything I had done in order to reach this point? God no. My name might go down in history as one of treachery, but the truth will always be there. I perfected the meal. I made the lives of the many more enjoyable. Some day they would understand. I took one last look at the empire I had built. They would never take me alive. The secret of the cookie dies with me. To whomever reads this, just know that there is always room for perfection. Even in the most simplest of things, like a cookie.

So it mostly boils down to \"is this version worth spending 3-4 bucks on or should i just  play the original with adblocker?\" Well, its complicated, you see the original browser version has a javascript console and it just so happens that a lot of the mods and addons for this game were played and loaded through that, also it had pretty accessible cheats to play around with and try some weird combinations with; on the other hand this version is more stable, less laggy, is integrated with steam features, is integrated with the workshop for easier mod loading and works with the browser saves; for example i imported my browser save and thats how i have the game on 94% completion with 40 minutes of steam playtime.  All in all its worth it, if you wanna try something more polished than the browser version and you don't mind the absence of the console, if you REALLY need it you can export your steam save to web, do the console editing with that and then import it back to steam.

I thought I'd enjoy this one as well, because it's seen as a classic among this genre.  Unfortunately I didn't really like this enough to stick with it for as long as most others.  The big thing that I didn't particularly like about this game was that at the start there are absolutely no offline earnings.  I understand limiting how much offline earnings you can get near the beginning of a game like this, but to have none whatsoever makes it harder for me to get into.  This is less an idle clicker and more of an active clicker that wants you to have the game open at all times to make progress, even if it's just in the background.  You do eventually get upgrades that give you offline earnings, but even then they're very limiting from what I've seen, like the first one only giving 5% earnings for a while when offline, and then going down to .5% if you take too long to check back in.  It seems a bit silly that this is a deal breaker for me, but once I'm past the beginning I just prefer to be able to occasionally open and check in on these games and get some upgrades before moving on to something else, rather than having them open on my computer all the time to make decent progress.

But by giving Orteil 5 dollars you are supporting the game that singlehandedly revived and popularized the \"idle game\" genre. (That, and the fact that you can show people how much of a psycho you are by getting all the achievements)  As for a review of the actual game, I think thats almost kind of not necessary since the game is free to play at [url= https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/]Orteil's site[/url]. You can basically play as long as you want there to see if it's something you enjoy enough to throw a couple bucks at. If you want my personal two cents, I think its been surpassed by better idle games at this point, but its such an absolute classic that I still put it up top as one of the most enjoyable ones you could possibly play. The flavour and weird minigames added over time really sell the presentation and game feel.

So much as been added to it over the years, and it's a very good experience, especially if you like having something to check up on in the background while you do other things. The game is still free on the web, so rather than reading a review to know if you like it, you should go and play it yourself a bit and see. :)  The Steam version only really makes a few tiny tweaks to the original web version, it's really just a nice little way for fans of the game to go and support it's developer, Oritel (which you should). The only features confirmed to be Steam exclusive are the yet-to-be implemented Steam Workshop support and the game's new soundtrack by C418.  As far as idle/incrementer games go, Cookie Clicker falls on the more simplistic side, or so I've been told at least. I've certainly noticed that every so often you run into sort of \"progression walls\" that you need to overcome by waiting for cookies to build up so you can buy an upgrade, or in the mid-game, ascending after massive amounts of prestige build up so you can buy new heavenly upgrades, especially permaslots for some upgrades. The late-game is spent by waiting for sugar lumps to upgrade buildings (which is very very slow) and/or repeatedly ascending every so often to add to your total prestige. This sort of design is both good and bad depending on who you ask, but for those who don't like being stuck waiting, many of these things can be improved or sped up with mods, which is a totally fine way to play the game. Many mods don't even disable the Steam Achievements, and you can even download a mod that forces them on, if you just want to make some personal tweaks to the way the game progression works. Personally I run the game with a good number of mods that allow me to automate a lot of things, since I find a lot of the fun of Cookie Clicker for me comes from the idling w/ occasional checking-in play-style.  Regardless it's well worth the 5 bucks, and makes for a great gift for friends as well. This was gifted to me for my birthday by my friend, ihaveamac. Thanks for that, buddy.

I am corrupt I did 911, I was in every possible scenario cookie clicking for my whole life, it is a never ending cycle of life and death that I have lived through only for the cookie clicking, I have sold my soul for cookies, I amputated my arms just for cookies, I am typing this now with my sentient cookie army.

If you see my wife and kids, tell them I love cookies.", "Cookie Clicker is damaging to yourself and those around you.  Cookie Clicker is an addiction. Based on my extensive naturalistic observation, I have seen how far a person can and will go in order to keep clicking cookies. This behaviour is very closely related to the behaviour of addicts, supporting my statement about Cookie Clicker being an addiction.  Cookie Clicker is the only thing on the effected person's mind. Even during the short periods where Cookie Clicker is not being played, the addicted individual will talk about Cookie Clicker any chance they get. Unfortunately, many people I know have faced this horrible addiction and I have seen how it takes over their minds. One time, while I was helping an addicted child overcome his problem, another addicted man came and stole the conversation from me turning it into a twisted talk of obsession. There was another time that really stood out in my mind about how Cookie Clicker is always on the effected individual's mind. I was in the car with two addicted individuals and was trying to have a normal, healthy, conversation with one. Sadly, the other person interrupted the conversation to talk about his cookies, and in doing so, he ruined a game that me and the other addicted person have been playing for years. That was truly a soul crushing moment for me.  As the addiction gets worse, the effected person will forgo any form of healthy social interaction to feed his addiction. There have been many times where I would try to enjoy some social time with a person who is addicted to Cookie Clicker, but they will always choose the game over real people. Sometimes, although it is rare, they will participate in social activity, but their thoughts are quickly consumed by cookies and it shows in their choice of conversation.  Like any addiction, the Cookie Clicker addiction is damaging to those who care for the addicted individual. The addiction will cause those who care for the effected person to feel guilty. The addicted person's family may feel responsible for that person's addiction. They will question how they have allowed them to develop an addiction, or perhaps they fought hard to help the addicted individual but were not able to help. Regardless of the circumstances, those who are close to the addicted individual will carry guilt and blame themselves to a certain extent.  As I mentioned earlier, I know people that are effected by this horrid game. I have seen others try to explain to them how damaging a simple game could be but they refuse to listen, and to some extent, those people blame themselves for not trying hard enough and letting them get sucked into this dark place. Another way it could affect those around the effected person is by them downplaying the problem. Like any addiction, people close to the person could just live in denial about the effected person's problem. They might make excuses for the person's behaviour or downplay the problem. They could also be scared about addressing the issue, worried about the possible future for the person, so they choose to ignore it instead of dealing with it.  At first I thought that this Cookie Clicker was a simple, although completely boring, game. Oh how wrong I was. The game slowly consumes the players, like a child eating cookies. I thought it was just going to be another game that people would quickly get bored of or forget about a few days later, and because of these thoughts, the Cookie Clicker addiction had time to fully manifest itself in their minds, since no one was trying to stop them. Another way it damages those around the addicted person, is that the addiction controls their mind. When people are addicted to something their whole life revolves around the addiction. It consumes their mind turning them into a different person, which is scary to those around them. Instead of the person seeing you as someone who cares for them, they will only see you as someone who is getting in the way of the only thing they care about, Cookie Clicker. You can try all you want to help the person get over this Cookie Clicker, but they won't see it that way. You could turn the computer off, but instead of the nice person you knew and cared for they will turn into some monster, screaming at you for making them lose their precious cookies. They are no longer the person you cared for.  Playing Cookie Clicker even just once is dangerous. Like any addictive thing, it may take only one time to become addicted. Cookie Clicker has just enough stuff for someone to keep on \"playing\" right from the beginning. At first you start with nothing, but as you continue clicking you gather enough cookies for upgrades, which make it so you can get more cookies faster, making you repeat an endless cycle of pain.  Cookie Clicker also has achievements for you to get, which keeps you hooked on the game. Not only does it have the upgrades that were mentioned earlier, but it also has achievements. Some of these achievement titles prove that the creators of the game are well aware that it's an addiction by having the achievement titles relate to drug use. One achievement is \"So baked right now\", another is \"Overdose\", and these sayings clearly show the relations to drug use.  Even if you manage to beat this addiction there is always the possibility of having a relapse. Unfortunately, no one I know has overcome this problem, but based on my knowledge of addictions, it's a very real possibility that they could suffer from a relapse. Relapses are a miserable part of addiction, even after you overcome the problem there is still a chance it could come back at any time. Possibly because of stress, negative emotions, really strong cravings, or being around things that remind you of Cookie Clicker. It is very damaging to your life and you might have to avoid cookies for the rest of your life unless you want to relapse. So you shouldn't play the game, even just once.  By now you should realize how dangerous this so called \"game\" is and the harmful effects it has on not only the player, but also those who care for the player.

I am 55.  My ex-wife and I had a son together, and adopted our daughter together. Both are 4 years old.  When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.  After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.  Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 minutes to the sounds of cookies and this games relaxing music while doing nothing long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.  After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.  Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.  I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.  Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.  Thank you Orteil,Dashnet for making this game and Playasaurus for publishing it.", "Cookie Clicker is a very mundane, albeit very addicting application where the main goal is to make your numbers of \"cookies clicked\" go higher, further, and faster. While not much of an actual game, and very easy to exploit, there's just something very engaging about buying upgrades and gaining achievements that makes these kinds of time wasters very fun for people like me. It hearkens back to a lot of browser games where you repeat the same process and try to get a better result, like Learn to Fly, or anything in that similar caliber. There's a lot of in-jokes, references, and bizarre little elements that add to the silly nature of what you are playing, and you could tell the creators had a sense of humor about adding fun content to such a straight forward premise.  There's more to the game than meets the eye, but probably far less than most people would find enjoyable, though I genuinely enjoy my time with this game. Mixing and matching certain upgrades, holiday bonuses, ascensions, stock market ventures, pantheon gods, and farms is really an interesting experiment that held my attention for much longer than it should have. I really recommend Cookie Clicker. It is a fun time waster/background application that has no business being as addictive as it is, and it just comes down to \"Haha, numbers go brrrrr!\" and it is very fun to me for some reason.", "Cookie Clicker            Cookie Clicker is a game about clicking a cookie. It's simple at first but gets increasingly complex. The late game meta has elaborate strategies to maximize cookie production, to unlock all of the upgrades and achievements, and to uncover the deep lore of the Grandmapocalypse, the Krumblor dragon, and the mysteries of the cookie universe. In the beginning, you click the cookie, which gets you one cookie. You click again and you've got two, then three. With fifteen cookies you can buy a cursor that clicks for you, making cookies automatically. Ten cursors make one cookie per second, or one CPS. So you make more cookies to buy more cursors to make more cookies, and then for a hundred cookies, you buy your first grandma. This kindly, old woman performs unpaid labor to grow your cookie business. Your cookies become popular in the neighborhood, then renowned all over town. Production accelerates exponentially; you buy cookie farms to grow cookies, mines to extract cookies from the earth, factories to produce cookies on an industrial scale. The cookie economy transforms the world around it. Chocolate pollutes the rivers, there's an obesity epidemic, but the world is too hooked on cookies to stop. Economists say that \"cookies permeate the economy,\" and if we start eating anything else, \"we're all dead\". Cookie banks start using cookies as currency, at temples, thousands pray to the baker in the sky. There is no value, no ideology, and no meaning beyond cookies. You produce hundreds of thousands of cookies a second, straining the fabric of reality itself. You build wizard towers and alchemy labs to summon cookies magically. You fly in shipments from space of cookies from alien worlds. You open portals to parallel dimensions, taking in millions of cookies per second. Alien beings and cosmic elder gods descend to taste your cookies, and entire cities are engulfed in trans-dimensional disaster. But the system can't stop. It can only grow, cookies are all we know. A local, confused idiot says, \"You gotta admit, all this cookie stuff is a bit ominous.\" Time machines bring cookies from the past, corrupting history with abominations of dough. You make cookies from antimatter, from light, from pure chance. You make cookies from other cookies, and cookies from beyond the fourth wall. You make trillions of cookies a second. The foundations of the cosmos crack under the mass of the cookie economy. Everything is transformed, either into cookies, or into the means to create cookies. The universe becomes cookie dough, down to the molecular level - an infinite, sentient, terrifying cookie gestalt. The only escape from the cosmic cookie machine is death, yet not even that can save you. When you're ready, you ascend. You leave the mortal world for a higher plane of mortal existence, where you can buy special heavenly upgrades. Then you are reborn into a new game with zero cookies to start it all again, but you keep certain upgrades and bonuses so you can quickly reach and surpass where you were before. So birth, death, and rebirth are an endless, inescapable cycle of cookie samsara.             But the cookies are not without cost. As production increases, the grandmas grow discontent. \"You make me sick,\" Grandma says, \"You could have stopped it,\" Grandma says. After the Bingo Center upgrade and the One Mind tech tree, the Grandmapocolypse begins. the indentured labor force at the bottom of the pyramid rebels, a hive mind of mutant grandmas rise, and transform the globe into and eldritch horror-scape of cookie-based monstrosity. Wrinkled \"flesh tendrils\" are visible from space, writhing masses of dough engulf whole cities, spreading across the globe like an infectious virus. The only way to end the Grandmapocolypse is with an Elder Covenant - you can sacrifice some economic gain to save everyone. But it can actually be more efficient to continue the disaster, and send everyone back to work anyway. Because the Grandmapocolypse spawns Wrinklers. Wrinklers leech 5% of CPS, but when you pop them, they give back more cookies than they took. So you can increase economic production by risking the lives of the elderly. Disaster is actually an opportunity to exploit the vulnerable to make more wealth. Ultimately, the cookie economy is not designed to help people, it just makes cookies. Like a virus or a tumor, Its nature is to exploit everything around it for its own expansion. Grandmas, banks, temples, every part of life is perverted to serve the purpose of \"the economy.\" Nothing is too sacred to be sacrificed on its altar. And for what? What's the point of a massive global economy if it fails to protect the elderly and the vulnerable? Even those with the most cookies don't really benefit from the system. Past a certain level of wealth, you can never spend that many cookies. And it's not like the game ever ends, you cannot win in Cookie Clicker. You just keep making cookies until you stop or you die. You're just hoarding cookies for its own sake. It's not really about the cookies, it's about the accumulation, getting more. You could be collecting any meaningless number: points, subscribers, small green pieces of paper - past a certain point, you're just making a number go up. And it's not even a real number, because like, look, behind the scenes, you can cheat, you can literally type in a number and print two trillion cookies out of thin air, their value is imaginary. And yet the lives and health of our grandmas are being risked to increase this imaginary number. The problem is that a system designed to make cookies is not designed to make wellbeing, or justice, or happiness. Any system of endless growth, of singular purpose, that warps the whole world around one goal, can only grow until it self-destructs.

There's currently 4 minigames that I think just alone make Cookie Clicker unlike any other idle game. The garden from the farm and the stock market from the bank are the two that have the most depth. These two minigames give you different ways to generate cookies or modify your cookie production and give completely different gameplay from just clicking a cookie.   The grandmapocalypse, the seasons and ascension add more layers to the idle gameplay by giving you modifiers and new cookies to obtain (except for business day...) along with ascension rewarding you by upping your cookie production by how many cookies you've for sacrificing your current run.

C418 music is relaxing and great. (off topic: check out his remix of the Stranger Things theme!)  Game is an electron wrapper. Works great for me on Linux with Proton Experimental.  A bummer: CPU usage yet is really high for me, even when running in the background. Is reported in the forums also on Windows systems. For some it might be related to high monitor refresh rates 244 Hz, or uncapped frames. Here for me it seems to be running at 60FPS. But I'm not 100% sure. So maybe uncapped frames/v-sync issue? Haha, anyways CPUs go brrrrrrr.  (pls fix.)  But altogether it is a good release on day one. Nothing ground breaking, but a nice touch and a nice way to support the developers, if you want to. I was more hyped about Cookie Clicker coming to Steam than I should have been. xD And really had my fun so far.  Some small technical fixes and some small optimizations would be nice. But it says what it does on the tin - and that VERY well. I especially do like that they did NOT change nearly anything at all. It's just Cookie Clicker as I loved it. They handled it really well. I guess the electron wrapper is the most sane option to go. It is solid Cookie Clicker on Steam. As we all love it. No BS. Very nice!

They began to joke that they were gonna beat me. Granted I had a few days head start, so I had little to worry about.   But catch up they did. The competitive side of me took over.

All early indications are that it is just as yummy as the browser version.  This is the game where you click on a large chocolate chip cookie to make more cookies, and use those cookies to buy clicky cursors, grandma bakers, cookie temples, and much more.    And yes, this is the one where the grandmas turn ... [b][i]weird.[/i][/b]  If you haven't played the browser version in a while, you've missed out on a LOT of added content.  Orteil's added new stuff a few times a year.  New buildings, new achievements, new features.  The change log here includes the web version's development, so you know what you've missed.  Upgrades are mostly in the form of various international cookies and sweet treats that add a small percentage to the cookie earning rate, plus boosts to the various buildings.  Several buildings have certain sub features.  Cookie farms give you a space for a garden to breed useful plants.  The cookie banks unlock a stock market where you can buy and sell cookies.  Personally, I haven't been much interested in those.  I'd rather just pursue the base game of buying buildings and upgrades and pursue most other achievements.  Yes, all those delicious and fun achievements are now Steam achievements!  The soft reset of prestige earns \"heavenly chips,\" which can then be used to buy a series of permanent upgrades such as offline earning, or unlock new cookie/treat upgrades.  Every chip you earn, even spent ones, persist to add to your overall cookie earning power.   I haven't bothered to try it for my game, but apparently the save codes for the web and Steam versions are compatible, even for older versions.  There's really nothing new content-wise between the web versions and this new Steam port. Orteil does promise to give both the web and Steam version parallel development.  There are, however some new useful options, including multiple language support, screen reader support, and new background music.  And, recently, Steam Workshop support for modders finally went live.  There's also a button here that tones down the crazier stuff without impacting gameplay.  If you know the game already, you know what that is.  If you don't, well, it takes three or four months of regular play to reach.   The only early (and very, very minor) criticism I have is that this port of a beloved free-to-play game (the web version is supported by unobtrusive ads and some Patreons) is $5.  But, of course, our Steam hosts have never allowed outside ads or stores that don't go through them.  It's a small price to pay to support a classic game and its developer.  Play this every day and you'll find you'll be spending two or three years or more.  You will see some holiday-themed events through the year, and eventually unlock a way to briefly bring back the events for a brief time.  On my web game I'm at 540+ days.  However, the Herald bonus (unlocked with prestige heavenly chips) that adds to your cookie baking rate is already more on the Steam version (based on Patreon support for web version, active players on Steam), so you might get farther faster here.", "\ud83c\udf6a?", "If you have any kind of self-respect, do not buy this game.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.  After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.  Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I clicked 500000 cookies with my dick to realize that I was going to be okay.  After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as. Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.  I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.  Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.  Thank you", "I've spent literally 10 days of my life clicking cookies 'n making slaves out of granmas.

But I'll keep trying from time to time because games like this remind me how fun it is.", "Click -> Cookies Simple!", "Finally a good game!", "Probably the best idle game.", "CND$ 5.69  The perfect price for the perfect game.", "\"Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, Creeps in this petty pace from day to day, To the last syllable of recorded time; And all our yesterdays have lighted fools The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player, That struts and frets his hour upon the stage, And then is heard no more. It is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.\"  When I first played \"Cookie Clicker\" I had assumed it was a fun and lighthearted game that I would play for 9 minutes and forget about, I was wrong. This game is a treacherous amalgamation of everything I hate in gaming. There is monotony, repetition, repetition, emphasis on story, and so much waiting. So tell me-why can't I stop? I can't quit  Every click is another hit of dopamine, I click the cookie, chemicals start flowing in my brain. I want to stop, but I have grown utterly dependent on these dopamine rushes, like an extra limb. I can't quit.  At first, this game strengthened my relationship with my grandmother, I went to her house thrice a week. After a few days, I unlocked an upgrade allowing me to create bingo centers, after this upgrade the grandmothers were scaring me, saying things like \"You disgust me\". I was too petrified to talk to my grandmother about this so I bought every upgrade to try to prevent the displeasure from furthering. Eventually, the grandmothers turned angry, and demonic worm-esque creatures appeared. I tried to stop it, I couldn't stop it. The grandmothers morphed into a sickening creature. I stopped talking to my grandmother three years ago, I was the only person who cared for her as she had developed blindness and could not care for herself. Sometimes I wonder what happened to her, my entire family still assumes I take care of her. I can't quit.  Every night I sleep will have a dream, it's never the same, but it's always about cookies. I see the cookies when I'm awake and when I'm asleep. My latest cookie-related dream was 3 days ago, I have been purposefully avoiding sleep as to not experience this dream again. In it, the cookie spoke to me. He told me I was wasting my life. I tried to ignore him, but I knew he was right. I can't quit.  Once I was holding a cookie, just staring, horrified at what I had become. I, in my immense fear, gripped the cookie tighter than it could handle. The cookie shattered. When the cookie shattered the pieces turned white, I was hallucinating about ascending, when I felt my body being torn apart. Thousands of knives were plunged into my body, and then everything stopped. All I could see was black. I had ascended. I was in this catatonic state for 34 hours, when I had somehow stumbled onto a college campus. This particular campus happened to be the one I had dropped out of months prior, to pursue my cookie clicking. A student found me and brought me to the counselor, I told her my story and I told her my woes. She told me I needed help, she didn't understand that I can't quit.  This game has ruined my life. It's all I ever think about. I can't do anything else without the cookies encroaching on the cage that is my mind. I can't quit.  \"They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly, But, bear-like, I must fight the course.\"  Vote game for steam awards lol", "The best idle game of all time, now with great music and cloud saving with mods to come in the future.

A true pioneer of idle gaming, as someone who had been playing this game since he could say cookie\u2026okay not that far back of course, but it was a very long time ago. It\u2019s insane to see such a beautiful base game become even more fully fleshed, whether it\u2019s the early game joy, the mid game envelops, or the late game franticness, Cookie Clicker has something to offer for absolutely every player. When thinking of an idle game, it sounds barebones, but the truth is, out of the basic ones that I have played, as a true idle gaming lover, Cookie Clicker stood out to me then, and does even now.  The pure euphoria of watching numbers slowly rise or simply blaze up into skyrocketed values is un-matched, not to mention the abundance of minigames, who would\u2019ve ever thought you\u2019d be able to play [b]GAMES[/b] in an [b]IDLE GAME[/b]\u2026crazy stuff\u2026I know.   Jokes aside, if anyone\u2019s even considering buying this, [b]just do it.[/b] The fun is truly in watching the numbers rise as if you were a millionaire, and personally, that\u2019s why idle games appeal to me. The mind of having near infinite progress, when playing can be great, but the fact that I\u2019m able to progress while I\u2019m playing Payday 2 with 20 mods for 10 hours endlessly is something that I will NEVER get over. It\u2019s just music to my ears or clicks to my mouse rather. The fun comes from the progress, whether we like it or not, as humans, seeing things rise, seeing growth, monetarily, spiritually, personally, you name it, it\u2019s all influential to us. I know, this sounds deep but, it\u2019s the truth! Cookie clicker blends active gameplay features such as golden cookies for buffs, upgrades and buildings, minigames, prestiges, and in \u2013 game events, with idle gameplay that can be FURTHER amplified by these upgrades. You really can\u2019t go wrong with this fantastic game.

[/list] [h1]Cons[/h1][list] [*]To be honest, the game is [b]too slow without mods[/b]. So, make sure you take advice and check the Workshop for things that interest you! Yes, the game is \"faster\" but it just means you can actually play the game if you want to! [/list]   [h1]Closing[/h1] I saw a review near the top mentioning that they bought a free game, I think that's a really nice way to encapsulate this game. It's a classic, and I wanted to get it on Steam so that my legacy can be recorded. In a year, I wanna look back and see what achievements I got and when, I wanna know my hours played and I wanna see what the community has made.  I like these kinds of games because you can just let 'em do their thing in the background while you write or watch TV. If you like having something to check in-between episodes or while you're queued up then you may as well let this game take that spot. Good job Orteil and Dashnet for making something that really did define the genre, hope you made some fat bank while you were at it!

Costs Cookie Clicker is damaging to yourself and those around you.  Cookie Clicker is an addiction. Based on my extensive naturalistic observation, I have seen how far a person can and will go in order to keep clicking cookies. This behaviour is very closely related to the behaviour of addicts, supporting my statement about Cookie Clicker being an addiction.  Cookie Clicker is the only thing on the effected person's mind. Even during the short periods where Cookie Clicker is not being played, the addicted individual will talk about Cookie Clicker any chance they get. Unfortunately, many people I know have faced this horrible addiction and I have seen how it takes over their minds. One time, while I was helping an addicted child overcome his problem, another addicted man came and stole the conversation from me turning it into a twisted talk of obsession. There was another time that really stood out in my mind about how Cookie Clicker is always on the effected individual's mind. I was in the car with two addicted individuals and was trying to have a normal, healthy, conversation with one. Sadly, the other person interrupted the conversation to talk about his cookies, and in doing so, he ruined a game that me and the other addicted person have been playing for years. That was truly a soul crushing moment for me.  As the addiction gets worse, the effected person will forgo any form of healthy social interaction to feed his addiction. There have been many times where I would try to enjoy some social time with a person who is addicted to Cookie Clicker, but they will always choose the game over real people. Sometimes, although it is rare, they will participate in social activity, but their thoughts are quickly consumed by cookies and it shows in their choice of conversation.  Like any addiction, the Cookie Clicker addiction is damaging to those who care for the addicted individual. The addiction will cause those who care for the effected person to feel guilty. The addicted person's family may feel responsible for that person's addiction. They will question how they have allowed them to develop an addiction, or perhaps they fought hard to help the addicted individual but were not able to help. Regardless of the circumstances, those who are close to the addicted individual will carry guilt and blame themselves to a certain extent.  As I mentioned earlier, I know people that are effected by this horrid game. I have seen others try to explain to them how damaging a simple game could be but they refuse to listen, and to some extent, those people blame themselves for not trying hard enough and letting them get sucked into this dark place. Another way it could affect those around the effected person is by them downplaying the problem. Like any addiction, people close to the person could just live in denial about the effected person's problem. They might make excuses for the person's behaviour or downplay the problem. They could also be scared about addressing the issue, worried about the possible future for the person, so they choose to ignore it instead of dealing with it.  At first I thought that this Cookie Clicker was a simple, although completely boring, game. Oh how wrong I was. The game slowly consumes the players, like a child eating cookies. I thought it was just going to be another game that people would quickly get bored of or forget about a few days later, and because of these thoughts, the Cookie Clicker addiction had time to fully manifest itself in their minds, since no one was trying to stop them. Another way it damages those around the addicted person, is that the addiction controls their mind. When people are addicted to something their whole life revolves around the addiction. It consumes their mind turning them into a different person, which is scary to those around them. Instead of the person seeing you as someone who cares for them, they will only see you as someone who is getting in the way of the only thing they care about, Cookie Clicker. You can try all you want to help the person get over this Cookie Clicker, but they won't see it that way. You could turn the computer off, but instead of the nice person you knew and cared for they will turn into some monster, screaming at you for making them lose their precious cookies. They are no longer the person you cared for.  Playing Cookie Clicker even just once is dangerous. Like any addictive thing, it may take only one time to become addicted. Cookie Clicker has just enough stuff for someone to keep on \"playing\" right from the beginning. At first you start with nothing, but as you continue clicking you gather enough cookies for upgrades, which make it so you can get more cookies faster, making you repeat an endless cycle of pain.  Cookie Clicker also has achievements for you to get, which keeps you hooked on the game. Not only does it have the upgrades that were mentioned earlier, but it also has achievements. Some of these achievement titles prove that the creators of the game are well aware that it's an addiction by having the achievement titles relate to drug use. One achievement is \"So baked right now\", another is \"Overdose\", and these sayings clearly show the relations to drug use.  Even if you manage to beat this addiction there is always the possibility of having a relapse. Unfortunately, no one I know has overcome this problem, but based on my knowledge of addictions, it's a very real possibility that they could suffer from a relapse. Relapses are a miserable part of addiction, even after you overcome the problem there is still a chance it could come back at any time. Possibly because of stress, negative emotions, really strong cravings, or being around things that remind you of Cookie Clicker. It is very damaging to your life and you might have to avoid cookies for the rest of your life unless you want to relapse. So you shouldn't play the game, even just once.  By now you should realize how dangerous this so called \"game\" is and the harmful effects it has on not only the player, but also those who care for the player.

Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture. Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies). Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown. Cool completely before serving. Enjoy!

You will not stop until every Planck distance in ever Planck time in every reality to ever exist is cookies. When you reach infinity, KEEP GOING! Is the number of cookies countably infinite? Make it UNCOUNTABLY INFINITE! And then expand to infinities bigger than that. Find the Vsauce videos about counting past infinity and Supertasks and do that.

[b]Why do cookies spread & flatten?[/b] There are a few main reasons for this that I have found in my experience: [olist] [*]Expired leavening agents. If your baking soda or baking powder are past their prime, your chocolate chip cookies will likely flatten and spread. Even if the date on the container checks out, it still might not be good. That would be the first place I would start. [*]How to test if your baking soda is active: Combine \u00bd cup of hot water, \u00bc teaspoon vinegar and \u00bc tsp of baking soda. When you add the baking soda a reaction should take place immediately. If not, then you need new baking soda. How to test if your baking powder is active: Add  \u00bd tsp of baking powder to \u00bd cup of hot water. It should bubble immediately. A reaction should take place immediately. If not, then you need new baking powder. [*]Over-mixing. If you over-mix the ingredients in this best chocolate chip cookie recipe you may end up with flat cookies. [*]Ingredients are too warm. Sometimes over-mixing can also lead to your ingredients becoming too warm. If you notice this happening, you can chill the dough before baking to return the batter to room temperature. [*]Incorrect oven temperature. I recommend baking with an electric convection oven. If your cookies and other baked goods are not turning out properly, invest in a cheap oven thermometer to check the temperature. If your oven is baking too hot or too cold, then the cookies will not turn out well. [/olist]  [b]Why didn't my cookies flatten?[/b]  If your cookies didn't flatten, here are a few things that could've been the problem. I have never had this happen to me in 10 years, so here are my educated guesses... [olist] [*]The ingredients/cookie dough was too cold. Cold dough doesn't spread as well as room temperature dough. [*]You accidentally used too much flour. Be sure to use a measuring cup made for dry ingredients (not a pyrex liquid measuring cup), and measure the flour correctly by scooping and leveling. [*]The oven temperature is incorrect. I recommend using an oven thermometer to check the temperature of your oven (it's only $7), because it can often be different than the reading it gives on the display or what the dial is set at. [*]The butter/sugar mixture wasn't fully creamed. Try creaming the butter and sugar together for longer. [/olist]  [b]Can you bake chocolate chip cookie dough from frozen?[/b] I have tested baking this recipe from frozen more times than I can even count. I have gotten the best results when I place the dough on a parchment lined baking sheet. Then, preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (ONLY if you are baking the frozen dough) and put the cookies in the oven in the beginning of the preheating time. Set the timer for 15 minutes and remove the cookies after 15 minutes. The top will look a little more brown than usual, but they will still taste amazing.

I bought the game only because I had a vague recollection of my younger brother playing it on a browser years ago and also because a lot of my /r/Steam friends were buying it on launch day. [b]Still,[/b] I did have a few memorable moments with this game; sharing progress amongst them on a discord thread that was created just for this game, over-hyping it into 'Game of the Year' status, and seeing how people would pay money for a free Javascript browser game that used more resources to run via Electron just because it added Steam Achievements, etc.  [u]It's not an addiction.[/u]", "Mouse don't work no more.", "makes my brain tingle ", " This took more than 300 hours from my limited lifespan.

Green (1844\u20131917) started as the Principal of the Groton School in 1864. By 1865, he became second assistant librarian at the New York Mercantile Library; from 1867 to 1869, he was promoted to full librarian. From 1869 to 1873, he worked for Evarts, Southmayd & Choate, a law firm co-founded by William M. Evarts, Charles Ferdinand Southmayd and Joseph Hodges Choate.

Love cookie clicker very quality  addict- I mean gaming experience.", "It was fun until it consumed me for 1580 hours. I was unable to enjoy other games and would always alt+tab when I hear that chime. Please run while you have the cha-", "pain", "Cookie Clicker is damaging to yourself and those around you.  Cookie Clicker is an addiction. Based on my extensive naturalistic observation, I have seen how far a person can and will go in order to keep clicking cookies. This behaviour is very closely related to the behaviour of addicts, supporting my statement about Cookie Clicker being an addiction.  Cookie Clicker is the only thing on the effected person's mind. Even during the short periods where Cookie Clicker is not being played, the addicted individual will talk about Cookie Clicker any chance they get. Unfortunately, many people I know have faced this horrible addiction and I have seen how it takes over their minds. One time, while I was helping an addicted child overcome his problem, another addicted man came and stole the conversation from me turning it into a twisted talk of obsession. There was another time that really stood out in my mind about how Cookie Clicker is always on the effected individual's mind. I was in the car with two addicted individuals and was trying to have a normal, healthy, conversation with one. Sadly, the other person interrupted the conversation to talk about his cookies, and in doing so, he ruined a game that me and the other addicted person have been playing for years. That was truly a soul crushing moment for me.  As the addiction gets worse, the effected person will forgo any form of healthy social interaction to feed his addiction. There have been many times where I would try to enjoy some social time with a person who is addicted to Cookie Clicker, but they will always choose the game over real people. Sometimes, although it is rare, they will participate in social activity, but their thoughts are quickly consumed by cookies and it shows in their choice of conversation.  Like any addiction, the Cookie Clicker addiction is damaging to those who care for the addicted individual. The addiction will cause those who care for the effected person to feel guilty. The addicted person's family may feel responsible for that person's addiction. They will question how they have allowed them to develop an addiction, or perhaps they fought hard to help the addicted individual but were not able to help. Regardless of the circumstances, those who are close to the addicted individual will carry guilt and blame themselves to a certain extent.  As I mentioned earlier, I know people that are effected by this horrid game. I have seen others try to explain to them how damaging a simple game could be but they refuse to listen, and to some extent, those people blame themselves for not trying hard enough and letting them get sucked into this dark place. Another way it could affect those around the effected person is by them downplaying the problem. Like any addiction, people close to the person could just live in denial about the effected person's problem. They might make excuses for the person's behaviour or downplay the problem. They could also be scared about addressing the issue, worried about the possible future for the person, so they choose to ignore it instead of dealing with it.  At first I thought that this Cookie Clicker was a simple, although completely boring, game. Oh how wrong I was. The game slowly consumes the players, like a child eating cookies. I thought it was just going to be another game that people would quickly get bored of or forget about a few days later, and because of these thoughts, the Cookie Clicker addiction had time to fully manifest itself in their minds, since no one was trying to stop them. Another way it damages those around the addicted person, is that the addiction controls their mind. When people are addicted to something their whole life revolves around the addiction. It consumes their mind turning them into a different person, which is scary to those around them. Instead of the person seeing you as someone who cares for them, they will only see you as someone who is getting in the way of the only thing they care about, Cookie Clicker. You can try all you want to help the person get over this Cookie Clicker, but they won't see it that way. You could turn the computer off, but instead of the nice person you knew and cared for they will turn into some monster, screaming at you for making them lose their precious cookies. They are no longer the person you cared for.  Playing Cookie Clicker even just once is dangerous. Like any addictive thing, it may take only one time to become addicted. Cookie Clicker has just enough stuff for someone to keep on \"playing\" right from the beginning. At first you start with nothing, but as you continue clicking you gather enough cookies for upgrades, which make it so you can get more cookies faster, making you repeat an endless cycle of pain.  Cookie Clicker also has achievements for you to get, which keeps you hooked on the game. Not only does it have the upgrades that were mentioned earlier, but it also has achievements. Some of these achievement titles prove that the creators of the game are well aware that it's an addiction by having the achievement titles relate to drug use. One achievement is \"So baked right now\", another is \"Overdose\", and these sayings clearly show the relations to drug use.  Even if you manage to beat this addiction there is always the possibility of having a relapse. Unfortunately, no one I know has overcome this problem, but based on my knowledge of addictions, it's a very real possibility that they could suffer from a relapse. Relapses are a miserable part of addiction, even after you overcome the problem there is still a chance it could come back at any time. Possibly because of stress, negative emotions, really strong cravings, or being around things that remind you of Cookie Clicker. It is very damaging to your life and you might have to avoid cookies for the rest of your life unless you want to relapse. So you shouldn't play the game, even just once.  By now you should realize how dangerous this so called \"game\" is and the harmful effects it has on not only the player, but also those who care for the player. I truly hope that this paper will open people's eyes about this so called game, and that anyone who reads this won't let anyone they care for get sucked into this Cookie Clicker.", "cookie clicker fans when they click a cookie", "pleas help i cant stop clicker", "veri drug", "cookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookiecookie", "", "I click cookie.

Everything about the game felt extremely rewarding for the first 1,000 hours. I had my game up 24/7, but I actually played actively often. Golden cookies coming up like clockwork, getting x7 frenzy with x777 buff, or eventually dragon flight's x1111 buff, as often as I could. Sometimes playing all day and not realizing it/not being able to stop. Getting achievements was addicting, always wanting another.  Eventually I hit a wall, having trillions of heavenly chips, and in the quindecillions for cookies baked. Never wound up surpassing the 1 sexdecillion cookies baked achievement, until I decided to get the \"cheated cookies taste awful\" secret achievement, which I found out doesn't exist on the steam version and is only available on the browser version, but this led to an unfortunate outcome.   I figured out how to access the dev console by going into the game files. Used cheat codes I thought would give me the achievement. Saved my progress pre cheating, but forgot to paste it somewhere and wound up losing it and having my 1,000+ hour save corrupted with cheats. Frantically trying to fix the problem without succeeding led to me just wiping everything and starting over.   I was prepared going into the game to play as long as it took to get all the achievements so I really didn't care having to start over. When I launched the game with a fresh save, I was awarded the last 80 or so achievements I didn't have yet. Was really excited to have (as far as steam was concerned) completed the game, but I don't feel as good as I would if I had gotten the last 15% of achievements legit. Looked through all the achievements to see the cheated cookies one wasn't on steam and felt very stupid, but there also wasn't any accurate information online regarding cookie clicker steam secret achievements. Kind of feels bad, but I'm going to keep playing on my fresh save until I get all the in game achievements. Seeing my hours played increase is also pretty nice so I have that still.  It is a really enjoyable game, especially considering the $5 price tag. I wish things ended differently with my situation but I had fun for most of it. I recommend the game but I mainly am writing this to put it out there that you don't have to cheat at all for any of the achievements.

She raised me, she brought my first console, then my first computer and my first game on steam, she helped me get into a good university, follow my dreams and become who I want to... She taught me to read, taught me to love everyone and help whoever you can, to be friends with the very poor and the very rich... When I did stupid things, or thought in stupid ways, she was always there to reprehend and teach me, which made me a better person. When the covid-19 pandemic started, she was being treated on a tumor she had, which forced her to go to the chemo regularly. One day she was having a hard time breathing and was having a fever, since she was having the chemo, we believed it was because of that, but I insisted on bringing her to a hospital, and that was the last time I saw her, my best friend, my mother and grandmother... The last words we heard from her before she was sedated for the treatment were for me \"I love you, it is very hard to talk, but soon we will talk again\",  but we never did... I am telling you this because, back in (2014? 2015?), I showed her Cookie Clicker, she always loved games that she could spend hours in, like Mini Farm and other Facebook Games, I thought she would love Cookie Clicker game, and she did, she played so much it reached a point she had nothing to do anymore, she had gotten every achievement... I came to her house (where I live now alone, but I will soon live with my fiance\u00e9, who is to become my wife) and she was always playing Cookie Clicker, with her computer open while she was watching TV, while she was planning a party for a family member (something she always loved to do), while she was petting her dog, and while we talked for hours about my life in school and her problems with neighbors...  She eventually stopped, when she reached the \"end\", in her opinion, for some years, until back in (2019?) she started playing again, a lot things had been added that was not there when she played, the spells, the farm (she loved this one), the rituals (which she didn't understand, because she didn't speak english, she only spoke Portuguese, since we live in Brazil)... And again, she was always playing Cookie Clicker, again it became a fond memory for me... When she passed a year ago, I was broken, I lost the most important person in the world for me at that moment and since I lived with her, I was forced to live alone for the first time, I was forced to find a job while still studying for the university, I was forced to take care of the dog that belonged to her, to clean the house that belong to her, to cook in kitchen that used to be hers, it was very overwhelming, and I thought I couldn't take it...  But then I somehow stumbled in Cookie Clicker again, and it reminded me of all those memories, all those moments we had together while she was playing it, or the conversations we had about the game, even, sometimes, she explaining me the tricks she discovered that made her a lot of cookies really fast and stuff like that, and it made me feel a lot better somehow, trying to see the game through her eyes, trying to remember how I felt when we were together and why I loved her so much... Now the game is on Steam, and it is always open on my computer, while I work, while I study (since I don't play very actively, I am going very slowly), and it makes me feel so good, I keep thinking about her and how she loved it, and how she would have loved the bank mini-game that was added, and how she would surely find ways to maximize the profits on it, by micro-managing or by making a spread-sheet, I don't know how, but I do know she would find ways to be great at it... This game is very special to me, and it is always going to be, it makes me feel really happy.. And I would surely also recommend it to anyone, it is a very good game, with a lot of choices and ways to increase your CpS (Cookies per Second) in your own way, which makes it very interesting to play in parallel with friends, sharing how each achieved what they did, sharing the secrets they found (when I found the achievement for clicking the mini cookie on stats and shared with my grandma, she was so surprised and we had a great moment), and I am sure you will create nice memories with people that also plays the game and talk about the game with you. 10/10 - Best clicker game ever", "A classic online game that you wouldve played on an older computer, or one that was not used for gaming, but could support a sufficient time killer such as this  It has a simple, but addictive premise, you click a cookie, and gradually lose the need to as it becomes automated.

The good thing about Steam release of Cookie Clicker is the easy access to guides, the Steam community, C418 exclusive Steam ver game soundtrack, consistent offline progress tracking (huge problem on browser and definitely if you clear your browser cookies & history), Steam achievements, Steam cloud save files transfer, and the best feature of them all: Hours played ingame to let your friends know how little of life you enjoy.  Downside is that not 100% of the money I spent was sent to support Orteil the game's developer. He practically pioneered the idle game genre we have now. Many of which I have also enjoyed periodically and will be for years to come.  Yes! The game is free online via browser play. It's free on Google Play if you would like to enjoy it on your phone (though that version is a couple updates behind). But Orteil has kept up with this project since its first release online as a little JavaScript test during the days of late flash games golden era. His journey has been long yet he stated on twitter that he still have some more game ideas for Cookie Clicker.  You are welcome to not buy the game and enjoy it free online under Orteil's website domain. But if you do feel generous and want to support his work, maybe consider buying CC on Steam. Join his Patreon or get the merch. And maybe join the Discord to hangout or meet other inspired small game devs. All links can be found via the browser version.  Thanks for taking your time to read this and have a great day!

In this review, I will describe why this game is so good and why is it that popular.  For starters, Cookie Clicker is presented as a simple game. Clicking on the cookie offers you a cookie. The cookie is the currency of the game. With them, you will be able to buy upgrades and a grandmother who will make cookies for you!  Why is it so popular? At first I thought Cookie Clicker was just a meme game, but I realized that it really wasn't. Its concept so crazy is however very addictive. The banal idea of \u200b\u200baccumulating cookies is very simple, but it makes you want to go above and beyond. All players want their cookie, but they don't know that the only limit is time.  Despite this, the Cookie Clicker game has a big negative point, its repetitiveness. Simple mechanics are abused, I fully understand that a player does not find it fun to play it after a while. But the addition of Steam Achievements make you want to collect them.  To conclude, Cookie Clicker having revolutionized its genre, is a classic of video games. It has a lot of updates that always add more content. Besides, his music is composed by C418, which is an honor! I would rate this game 8/10.

Really brought into light how simple minded we are as a species. But then I ascended and the game opened up. Real strategy, real good decisions to be made.

Grease cookie sheets or line with parchment paper. Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt; set aside. In a medium bowl, cream together the melted butter, brown sugar and white sugar until well blended. Beat in the vanilla, egg, and egg yolk until light and creamy. Mix in the sifted ingredients until just blended. Stir in the chocolate chips by hand using a wooden spoon. Drop cookie dough 1/4 cup at a time onto the prepared cookie sheets. Cookies should be about 3 inches apart. Bake for 15 to 17 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the edges are lightly toasted.

So why am I playing a game with a big cookie instead of an Rpg, and making enough cookies to solve world hunger single-handedly?  One of the reasons Idle and clicker games do so well is it's game design in it's purest form - progression and positive reinforcement without the negative, Dopamine as numbers go up, similar to Runescape. there's a reason it's one of the best clicker games, it's simple, and good at what it does. You can play actively or have it in the background.  Music: Cookie Clicker unironically has great background music to listen to while working.  Price: Great value for the money, and the steam app is sleek, easy to use and fully playable offline, that alone makes the purchase worth it and better than the web version (as well as the future mod support). There is also cloud saving for those who play on multiple computers. It's also worth supporting the developers, especially if you've already enjoyed your time on the web version,  Why do I play this game over other idlers/clickers?  Because It follows the formula so well with a great feeling of progression and near infinite replayability  Achievements: Achievement hunters rejoice, there are any achievements to unlock, also make sure to look up shadow achievements as well.  Modding: I suggest the auto-click and buy mod if you plan on playing more passively while still making good progress.  My only gripe is sometimes Cookie clicker refuses to close and you have to do it manually via task manager.", "It's Cookie Clicker.

There isn't much to say about this game except that for as simple a concept as it is (to make more cookies by endlessly clicking on that one big cookie), there is a bit of depth for upgrading things, buying and selling when need be, and also dealing with the grandmas and the oddness that can happen when they are not appeased.

Closing the game by pressing the x button on the top right (in windowed mode) or in fullscreen mode pressing \"Save & Quit\" doesn't work.  2. The \"Fullscreen ON/OFF\" button doesn't always work.  3. Using Save States from the browser version works but is one of the reason these bugs are triggered.  4. Changing language doesn't always work since its requiring the game to reload which also doesn't work.  5. After Reinstalling the game, these bugs mentioned above do not get fixed, or at least not temporarily.

So, this game is the same as the web version, both of which will receive the same updates. Deciding to purchase the steam version is mainly just to support the developers (and to get those steam achievements ;D). Plus, you get a easily accessible downloadable version of the game. By using the steam version, we also get access to cloud saving which is a god send of course!

It was about a Grandma that I didn't need in my bakery anymore. She was a nice and funny lady that everyone loved, her name was Nana. She was starting to get very old and I had to get her out of the bakery. I discovered the other day that there is a steam achievement that I need to sell a grandma for. I sold Nana for the achievement.  There is no point in writing such a story because not many people will read it. I would like a lot of people to read it and comment their opinions about what I did. I would like to know what other people think of what I did to poor Nana.  I believe it will help me find out the truth much better whether I was a victim or monster.

But then as the day passed, the numbers went up. And as the numbers went up, I started to get more and more absorbed in the cookie business. Every time my Cookies Per Second increased, so did my levels of dopamine. It was too late for me to quit, I had to make more cookies.   I clicked for hours at a time, I gave up on everything else I had. I had to buy 17 new mice because they couldn't endure the multiple hours of intense clicking. But I didn't care, my Cookies Per second were still increasing.   I completely stopped doing anything that didn't help me click cookies, my healthy deteriorated faster than Greece's economy. But I didn't care, my Cookies Per second were still increasing.  I stopped going to work, I no longer had any source of income. Food was slowly running out. But I didn't care, my Cookies Per second were still increasing.   But suddenly, everything went dark. The cookies were no longer there, there was nothing but a black screen. The electricity went out as I had no money to pay for the electricity bills. I sat and stared at the screen as I realized what I had done. As I realized that this was all meaningless, I was making virtual cookies.   I then went into rehab, hesitant however as I was not sure of where that would lead me. I thankfully got out of that mess I was in, I was finally free. I got back on my feet again, found a great job that provided me with a great source of income, I rebuilt my life.  A week or so ago I was searching the steam store as usual, searching for a new game to pass a few moments of my time while I relax after my return from work. And I saw it. Cookie Clicker, on the front page. I froze, I couldn't believe it. I couldn't control myself, I had to buy the game. I just couldn't resist it. Seeing the new updates... the new ways to make cookies... it was the most irresistible offer I had ever gotten. I instantly bought the game.  I am now here, making cookies non-stop. The numbers are going higher by the seconds, I am no longer in the Cookie business, I am in the Empire Business.  I got fired from my job due to my recent absences.

[/h1] The name says it all! Cookie Clicker is an iconic idle clicker game, in which you click a cookie to earn, well, cookies! Those cookies are then used on buildings and upgrades to help make even more of them, rinse and repeat. If you're familiar with how idle games work, even if you've never played Cookie Clicker, you'll fit right in with no problems.  [h1] Pacing [/h1] The gameplay of Cookie Clicker is well paced, with early game becoming much quicker as you begin to ascend and earn heavenly upgrades. In late game, the grinding maintains a nice speed, made better with the ability to ascend at any time to earn a permanent multiplier on your Cookies Per Second (in the form of a percentage boost).  [h1] Graphics [/h1] If you haven't seen anything about the game, the visuals provide a nice and suitiable backdrop, with the ability to turn off the more fancy effects if you wish to. With all of them enabled, the game looks clear and plays incredibly smoothly, with solid 60 FPS, so you can see all your cookies rack up with no drops in the frames. To go with this, every achievement has it's own unique image to accompany it, and many of them are accompanied by quirky names and even the occasional reference to a game or meme! A very nice touch.  [h1] Why this version? [/h1] Some may argue that you can play the browser version of this game for free, but for the cheap price, this version of the game is well worth the cost. The soundtrack, handcrafted by none other than C418, (y'know, the legend who made the soundtrack to Minecraft!) provides a relaxing and immersive experience. With achievement support, the grinding you'll perform is also acknowledged, something that isn't present in the browser version of the game.  [h1] Summary [/h1] Overall, Cookie Clicker on Steam is an incredible experience for fans of the game, and is more than welcoming to those wishing to give the game a try for the first time. Whether you're a long time cookie entrepreneur, or a brand new baker, you'll find enjoyment out of this version of the hit clicker game.", "Fun clicker!", "The first minutes after opening the game:  Click +Cookie Click +Cookie Click  1 hour later:  Cookies needed=10^{12} .

Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture. Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies). Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown. Cool completely before serving. Enjoy!

I started playing a long time ago and when I heard there was a Steam version coming I bought it as fast as I could.   From the gameplay perspective this game might feel a little boring at first, but that's one of the tropes of Cookie Clicker: It teaches you patience. The game is very well balanced, so at first you don't get overwhelmed with features and new things come in at a steady rate, so you never get bored.  So what genre is Cookie Clicker you might ask? Well, you may think of it as a \"clicker\" game, but that's only scratching the surface. In reality it's a business/strategy game. \"But how is it a strategy game?\" You might ask. Well, in the late game there is a bunch of ways to make cookies and you need strategy for in which one to invest in, that's also how the business element works.   Are the graphics good? Yes  Is the soundtrack good? Yes (that's actually one of the things added with the Steam release). The soundtrack is made by C418, who also created the soundtrack for the pretty popular game Minecraft.  Is the gameplay good? It's exquisite  About the lore: Cookie Clicker provides a big philosophical insight into what makes capitalism work and where it fails. For some it can be an uplifting message - anyone can achieve anything. Others interpret it as a commentary to how capitalism destroys society. Personally I think it's a game about food.  There are many jokes and popculture references thrown into the game to brighten the mood. But there are also horror elements as well. Cookie Clicker really provides a bit of everything.  The difficulty of the game is determined by how far you want to go and by your patience. The hardest achievements may require a lot of grinding, but for a casual player that shouldn't be a problem.  Overall I think you should definitely buy Cookie Clicker, you'll support the developer and you'll for sure have an amazing time.", "It's Cookie Clicker. On Steam. With music, and achievements integration, and mods. The free web version remains unchanged and will receive the same core gameplay updates.  But now we also have a Steam version with a few bonus features.  Buy this if: - You want to support the developer and play without ads. - You'd like an (excellent) soundtrack by C418 to go with the game. - You want Steam achievement integration to share how much of your life you've wasted.  Don't buy this if: - You're expecting a remake. It's the same JavaScript game, launched through Steam with a few bonuses. - You have no idea what Cookie Clicker is. Play the free web game first to see if you like it. - You don't think the additional features are worth $5 of your money over the free version.", "Cookie. Swag.

It has a sense of satisfaction in its progression matched only by games far more mechanically complex than it. There is always something small to improve, which branches out into this incredible spider web of options to pursue as you adjust your strategies dynamically to maximise your output, in a way that never overwhelms the player. It also has minigames which add new incentives and concepts to the game that are themselves deeply addicting. However, it never abuses this addictiveness into exploiting the player through microtransactions, a testament to the developer's dedication to making the experience as pure as possible. I cannot recommend it enough.  I have played the game extensively on the browser platform (see my imported achievements), both as a hands-on experience and as a backburner idle game. For the amount of enjoyment I've gotten out of it, the price is incredible. While I eventually get bored of the game after a while, it pops back in my mind a year or so later, and takes over my life all over again.

Cookie Clicker is just kind of soul destroying to actually play (and I swear the progression curve is way less generous now which intensifies the issue by requiring longer play times to reach, e.g., the endgame grandmapocalypse, but I am not reinstalling to check the patch notes for balance changes or whatever because... no no that does not seem like a good idea for me).   And that is kind of a big problem because we only have so much time on this Earth and I don't think clicking a picture of a cookie while continually monitoring a fictional stock market is a good way to spend it?   Okay, you could say this point about pointlessness about pretty much any game, but Cookie Clicker is a game that wears the contradictions of video gaming on its sleeve (and so renders them particularly sharp) and while that does make it genuinely interesting from an artistic and satirical standpoint, it does still not make the actual experience of playing it good or healthy - indeed the feeling of compulsion I have to do something so openly and honestly pointless is probably actively unhealthy! (there's a reason I uninstalled after a few days!) - and I kind of have to base a recommendation of whether you should actually play this game on that.  tl;dr As much as a game about massively overproducing cookies being bad for you is kind of fitting... it is still kind of bad for you so maybe don't play it? Like eating a ton of actual cookies might straight up be better for you (or at the very least less bad), in addition to being more enjoyable        .... ... ... ... ... Okay, also, as a petty point, I swear the performance I've experienced is less than ideal. My machine does default to using the integrated GPU rather than the dedicated... but this does not feel like a game that should end up using basically all of said integrated GPU and making my computer straight up sound like a plane taking off at times, even with all the fancy bits turned off? Of course, this may be semi-inherent in Electron, based off my vague memories of using the Atom text editor back when that first came out, but I'm not sure and it is kind of a problem: as much as Cookie Clicker feels like it ought to be able to run on very low end machines (there's low inherent graphics requirements, but I guess the cookie counter updating continually might be an issue? But I am getting way way off topic and into semi-informed (at best) speculation for an aside at the end of a review on Steam here), I have no idea whether it actually will run for more than 10 seconds without something literally melting or whatever.  Now, to be clear, the performance improving massively would not change my review at all, because the issues I have are baked into the structure and nature of the game (pun not originally intended) but, hey, it's a point that might save someone from losing several hours of their life to this thing and it's worth bringing up just generally.", "i need therapy", "just to waste time", "wtf", "does what it says on the tin", "help ", "click cookie", "I NEED MORE GRANDMAS!", "click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click click", "PLEASE FOR ALL MY LOVE IN GOD DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME.

Seeing numbers go up makes you feel excited, but as soon as you stall it feels really disheartening to be forced to leave your computer running all throughout the night just to make progress in the game.  There's many basic features that should be available from the very moment you start playing, but they are locked behind upgrades that you'll only be able to unlock after ascending. Some even after ascending multiple times, which takes way too much grind to achieve.  The market minigame feels kind of pointless, and getting more wizard towers to get more mana is also pointless because mana costs scale with the towers you own. You're expected to sell them in order to get another shot at it, but not telling the player how to do it at all feels like a problem, not to mention getting the quantity right. It's counter-intuitive to sell anything at all because you crimp your cookie production, even when you have buffs like the idol that boosts your production after selling buildings.

I look at her with disgust. As if jobs give something valuable, all I need is to click the cookie.  It's 2 am when suddenly the game crashes, no worries, I'll just start it again.

A cookie is a baked or cooked snack or dessert that is typically small, flat and sweet. It usually contains flour, sugar, egg, and some type of oil, fat, or butter. It may include other ingredients such as raisins, oats, chocolate chips, nuts, etc. In most English-speaking countries except for the United States, crunchy cookies are called biscuits. Many Canadians also use this term. Chewier biscuits are sometimes called cookies even in the United Kingdom. Some cookies may also be named by their shape, such as date squares or bars.

I suppose it's called Cookie Clicker and not Idle Cookies for a reason.   The reason why is that progression in this game is extremely slow, especially at the start, unless you're constantly paying attention to it and clicking the golden cookies that appear every two minute or so on the screen.   Unlike in many other similar games where you can sorta choose between the active and the passive route, in this one the only way to get any semblance of progress at all is through big combos, which, while they are quite satisfying when you pull them off, are almost entirely reliant on RNG, which can make for a very frustrating experience if you're not the gambling type.  So this game takes up a lot of your time and attention, but it's not like it offers anything riveting in return, and most of the time you'll just find yourself blankly staring at the screen waiting for something to happen, occasionally spamming your left click, and the rest of the time it'll be in the back of your mind, distracting you from your other activities, but not in a good way.  The fact that there isn't even any offline progress until you unlock it through the ascension mechanic, and even then it's only a pitiful fraction of what you'd make with the game open, that was the nail in the coffin. To me the whole point of this kind of game is that comforting feeling of having something running in the background, progressing without needing input, and never feeling obligated to check back on it but being happy to do so because I'll know I'll be rewarded for my patience. I didn't find that with this game. It was fun for a few hours, maybe from the nostalgia factor as I remember playing this on browser many years ago, but it got old pretty quick.  As for the fact this game isn't free-to-play unlike most clicker/idlers, that's actually one of the few positives for me, as in this case it means no tantalizing micro-transactions. Its price is very cheap anyways... However if you value your time, I'd stay away from this one as it'll eat up a lot more of it than it ought to.", "im addicted i have no friends our family anymore", "I love Coochie Licker.", "I paid for a free game", "Finally a game I can use to hide my status while I watch pr0n", "just     C L I C C", "im making so many cookies.", "Its the same as the browser version and cost the same as if you donated on his site, so if you were going to donate anyway might as well get it on here.", "I love this game :)", "10/10 Would play again!!

I am 69.  My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.  When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.  After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.  Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.  After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.  Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.  I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD.

We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

One.", "It's a classic, yes. I played the heck out of it years ago, and I loved it. But since its inception dozens, if not hundreds of incremental clicker/idle games followed. I played many of them. Idle Slayer, Clicker Heroes, Venture Communist/Capitalist, that Evolution game turning into The Matrix, all parts of Candy Box, I don't know. I'm an office worker, of course I know these games. And now, after eight years, it's very hard to say, but  [b]Cookie Clicker fails at everything good.[/b]  Okay, let's start.  [h1]The Good[/h1]  It's a classic. Mmh.. What else?  [h1]The Bad[/h1]  First: No idle income. Yes, you read that right. You don't get anything from turning the game off and going to your day job. You could let it running, sure, but seriously, what year are we? On top of that the developer added a handful of minigames that let you wait for a number of minutes, like ten or twenty, but demand your interaction or else the reward necessary to progress in the game is lost. Essentially the game was turned from an idle game into a waiting game. Great job?  Second: The progression mechanic. Of course you need to reset to get an amount of Other Currency[tm] and maybe get an advantage for the next incarnation, like in all incremental games. Unfortunately it is never communicated [i]when[/i] to reset. Do I wait until I get to the last building or do I reset before? Coupled with the nonexisting idle mechanic this is an absolute failure. In addition the devs added [i]another[/i] currency that you can use to level up in between without resetting, and to use with the minigames, so it demands even more interaction, but also more waiting, because this currency regenerates [i]once[/i] ([b]1\u2a2f!![/b]) per day. It is tedious.  Third: The minigames, and the overall game. Yes, these deserve a seperate point. Simply: Why? What is this? Why should I use these? There is a garden. This garden is supposed to grow plants, from random mutations. Some of these mutations have a random chance of 0.1% per tick. Each tick is between 3 and 15 minutes. You start with a plot of 4, and to get a maximum plot you need to wait 55 days. In addition to the weeks or months you wait to get all these plant mutations. And if you miss the right time to harvest your plants and possible mutations, its gone. No stepping back, no idle harvesting, no one to pay attention. You start from anew.  And that is [b]ONE[/b] of these minigames! I have just one question: Why? To slow down the next step or the end of the game? Where's the fun in that?  [h1]The Ugly[/h1]  That part pains me the most. I love Minecraft, okay, I admit it. I love the soundtrack by C418. I bought his Bandcamp discography, I follow him on Twitter, but \u2026  \u2026 after ten repeats his tune sucks. Sorry. I said it. Put it away, turn it off, forget it.  Make more techno, Dan, please.  [h1]Conclusion[/h1]  Don't buy this game. There are dozens if not hundreds of incremental/clicker/progressing games on Steam for free. Try some of those.", "Steam Autumn 2021 sale nominations task", "In electromagnetism, a dielectric (or dielectric material or dielectric medium) is an electrical insulator that can be polarised by an applied electric field. When a dielectric material is placed in an electric field, electric charges do not flow through the material as they do in an electrical conductor, because they have no loosely bound, or free, electrons that may drift through the material, but instead they shift, only slightly, from their average equilibrium positions, causing dielectric polarisation. Because of dielectric polarisation, positive charges are displaced in the direction of the field and negative charges shift in the direction opposite to the field (for example, if the field is moving parallel to the positive x axis, the negative charges will shift in the negative x direction). This creates an internal electric field that reduces the overall field within the dielectric itself. If a dielectric is composed of weakly bonded molecules, those molecules not only become polarised, but also reorient so that their symmetry axes align to the field.", "I clicked a few times I guess", "Sometimes, things are better left unchanged in the past.

Seeing that the reviews are overwhelmingly positive already i thought i'd not recommend it and list my problems with the game, since i don't think that rating is deserved.  1. The game is too active There is no offline progression at first and even after maxing it later you still get far more by leaving the game running. I really dislike when developers do this since it really encourages you to let the game run over night. That being said, the main reason this game is too active are the golden cookies. Those are periodically appearing icons that, once clicked, give you bonuses. This would be fine, and many games do this too, but the boni you get are so increadibly strong that not staying vigilant and clicking the golden cookies nets you so much fewer income that it becomes no contest. Later on you get the possibility to have more of an idle playstyle but nothing will come close to layering the golden cookie bonuses on top of each other.  2. The game is short Very, very short. I played the game way back when for a bit, never got to actually ascend. When it released on steam i thought to give it a shot again, so my experience was close to that of a new player. There is one prestige mechanic and nothing after that. Prestigeing for the first time with 450 prestige currency took 2 days for me and another 3 days later i am at 150 million prestige currency (playing actively). So after not even 5 days i have seen most of the prestige tree, so the only thing that's left is getting the rest of the tree for some more % bonuses and getting the rest of the achievements (some of which take a very long time). If you can stick with the game until you reach either of these you can spent a while in it (according to the internet) but the only thing you`ll get are some minor bonuses to a system you already know. There is no new prestige tier, you will have maxed out all the available buildings and the general system of how you get income will no longer change.  3. The minigames And the associated sugar lumps. Essentially you wait 24 hours to unlock one of 4 \"minigames\" and after that you will get 1% income bonus to one of the buildings. Considering this with the pervious point made, this system rather seems like a sinical joke than an actual system. And the minigames you unlock are... well. I`d say there only is one, the others are stale by doing the same thing every time, sometimes even without an interval just once per ascension. Essentially if you consider being able to click a button once in a while for more income a minigame, then these are for you.  Now as mentioned i focused heavily on the negative parts of the game and only mentioned things i found negative. There is more to it than this, just that these things outweigh the good for me. But in the end i can only repeat myself: you can have a decent time in this game and many people seem to agree. So if you wanna give it a shot, i won`t judge you.", "It's the website, but on steam...

I know this game is old but what's the point of an idle game if i have to grind the life out of it before i can go offline without completely stopping my progression?   Even if you used an autoclicker you'd still need a couple of dozens of hours of it doing work as you buy buildings to reach to a point where you can buy the upgrades that give you atleast 8 hours of optimal offline progression and, if you do that, you've pretty much wasted your first ascension because other than the prestige production bonus you'd be left without many other upgrades so you'd be starting from \"scratch\" depending on how deep you went into the rabbit hole in your first ascension leaving the pc on at all times.  The game is fun and has a lot of stuff to sink your time on later on, but unless you are ready to leave the pc on at all times, want to use an autoclicker (which kind of ruins the game) or have tons of free time....i can't see it working.  Right now i turned it off. 20 hours of playtime, 3 of them with an autoclicker mod just for science. I'm still a long way of making it viable to just turning it off as right now my progression is completely halted.

Cookie Clicker wants you to constantly pay attention to it despite it being an incremental game, a genre of game that you're not supposed to give constant attention to. Here's a list of offenses:  -[b]No offline progress.[/b] Offline progress for incremental games is pretty standard, so the fact that this game doesn't have it is insane. There's an upgrade you can get later on where you unlock offline progress, but it's so miniscule it might as well not even exist (5% production for the first hour, then 0.5% from then on). I wouldn't have an issue with this if the absence of this feature was compensated for in other areas. Spoiler warning: it doesn't.  -[b]Requires constant attention.[/b] Progressing at any decent rate requires you to pay attention to the game at nearly all times, since the only form of automation is how many cookies per second you make. This is understandable at the beginning of the game since you get buildings and upgrades pretty quickly, and random golden cookie spawns and seasonal objects can be clicked on to give you even more cookies. Unfortunately, time between buildings and upgrades eventually becomes so long that you depend on golden cookie spawns since building production amounts are several magnitudes lower than what they cost. I have other games and priorities that vye for my attention, so this is just not fun to deal with.  -[b]Can't run in background without performance hit.[/b] This point is an extension of the previous one, but I felt it was appropriate to separate it. It's pretty common to run incremental games in the background while you do other things and occasionally check back. Again, Cookie Clicker is a selfish game, even on the lowest settings. Doing anything with Cookie Clicker running in the background will cause a noticeable performance hit, be it an FPS hit in your game or a chugging internet browser. And no, it's not my computer. I have an i7-7700 CPU and 16 GB of RAM.  -[b]Progression keeps slowing down.[/b] The gap between building costs and cookie production keeps increasing, the amount of cookies you need to produce to receive heavenly chips (needed to put points into the ascension tree, which the costs of everything at the very start are very high btw) increases exponentially, and golden cookie spawns help less and less, even after I installed a mod that clicks the cookies for me as soon as they spawn. You do get sugar lumps that let you upgrade buildings and unlock minigames, but the minigames are either small buffs or require even more attention to the game. I'm not going to leave my computer running for days just so I can get the next heavenly chip that requires me to make 2.000e15 cookies when I'm only producing 4.143e8 cookies per second.  Cookie Clicker at first glance appears to be a solid incremental game, especially with the ascension skill tree, but the above issues leaves a sour taste in my mouth with how little the game respects my time. I don't think I'll bother, I have more important things to attend to.", "so uh this is my most played game on steam now...  i feel empty.", "Perfect for someone with no time, game plays itself and has such a charming look.

There are upgrades allowing you to generate cookies while offline, but they come later in the game and are honestly insulting as they give but a fraction of your total cookie production. I just can't comprehend what the average player is meant to do here. Other idle games have no problem calculating offline progress.

It scared me, honestly, but the game isn't doing me any harm, I don't understand why she wants me to turn it off. I don't even have it up, it just stays minimized, I don't get her problem.  Day 10,  She is threatening to take the kids if I don't stop playing this game, I don't get it, but I told her today that I got rid of it on my Steam account, she seems to be fine and today we finally held each other in the sweet embrace of love for the first time since I started playing. Little does she know, I just hid it on my task bar...  Day 38, She caught me. Omg, she broke my keyboard (luckily I had another in the closet) and screamed at me from playing it again. She didn't even let me say anything, she just started packing her things and grabbed Mike and Laura's hands *(my two children) and got in the car and left for her Mom's house. I just sat there and cried on the couch as the beautiful clicking sounds of that cookie with C418's music played softly in the background.  Day 40, Her Mom called me and asked what happened, to which I tried to explain, but Katie *(my wife of six years now) hung up the phone before yelling \"GET OFF OF THAT STUPID F****** GAME OR I'M SENDING THE PAPERS\". I just stood there and began to cry as the music kept going in the background.  Day 69, I signed the divorce papers today. I don't know why, but suddenly I'm finding cookies in my shelves. I don't even know why they are there, I haven't bought cookies, have I? My boss caught me playing it at work, but he tapped me on the shoulder and winked saying \"Don't worry, I play it too\". He is such a good guy, gave me a raise when he heard about what happened.   Day 72,  Mike and Laura called me today, it was the first time I've heard their voice since Katie left. A bit sad, but they refuse to call me Dad anymore, Katie said I don't have to pay child support and she doesn't want to court saying \"You wouldn't even come, you just stay on that f***ing idle game all day.\"  Day 200,  It's been over a year now.

If the memory leaks gets fixed then you should play it 25/8, but other than that don't run this, could be harmful to your computer.  Edit to add something, this doesn't add anything to the game, I could understand charging if there would be features added, or maybe offline support like basically every other idle game.

Why do I install idle games thinking that this time will be different? I've already played dozens and I know what to expect. No interesting decisions. Hardly any participatory gameplay. Just a genre that's defined by marking your progress in the game with the actual progress of time. Games you play by not playing them, checking in periodically to buy some upgrades so that you will progress faster while you don't play them. Marking out seconds, minutes, hours of your time by making numbers go up in a game that doesn't need your intervention or attention. You could cease to exist, and Cookie Clicker would still keep progressing. Is that why we play them? Are idle games a chance at immortality? Even after we die, after we turn to dust, after nobody speaks our names, we will still be accumulating cookies even as the stars wink out and reality ends and transforms into something new, something different. Will we reemerge, shedding our physical forms to become light, to become electricity, free of the physical shackles which once ensnared us, and in our new way of being all we will carry with us are the electronic cookies that we made?", "Classic and one of the first idler incremental games. Really should cost $4.99 + the cost of a new mouse.  Anyway, while the game is fine and overall fun, there are a few big issues that keep me from giving it a thumbs up at this time.  First, there are some bugs with the port. Sometimes the game doesn't save properly and/or sync with the cloud saving. Minor issues where you can just copy your save code and import it and such.  But the bigger issue is that there's no way to play other games on Steam while it is running. Normally, when it runs in a browser, it is in the background and isn't a big deal. But the way Steam works means you can't have 2 games playing at the same time with them both being online at the same time. I could go \"offline\" on one computer running it but then I might as well just use the browser, plus that requires 2 computers.  I wish they would enable a way for the game to be closed and still function at 100% ... they would need to rework how the \"idle while game is closed\" bonuses for other things work, but it would free up the ability to play other Steam games while also \"playing\" Cookie Clicker.  If they can fix these two issues the game would definitely be a thumbs up for the nostalgia, history, and overall decent idle gameplay.  P.S. I hope some other idlers/incrementals come to Steam... maybe in some group bundle including: Candy Box 1/2, A Dark Room, Crank, Universal Paperclips, The Prestige Tree, Antimatter Dimensions, and others.  EDIT: The main issue I was having was due to cloud saving sync issues with Steam. The issue still remains if you have Cookie Clicker running on one computer and want to play a game on the other. No easy way to solve this since it is on Steam's hands, but it would be nice if Cookie Clicker had an \"offline idle\" with 100% values instead of requiring upgrades. Steam is a different platform than browsers and as such should be designed slightly differently.", "A boring game about girl scouts or something.

If you like idle games, skip this game, NGU Idle or Clicker Heroes are way better than anything this could ever be. I have no idea why people are reviewing this so highly or why it's so raved about. No offline production until you're really deep into the ascension upgrade tree, people making mods so that idling is more viable. What a state of a game, honestly.

To really progress through the main game requires a decent amount of active play trying to get golden cookie combos, but once you've unlocked all of that you're suddenly gated by weeks to months of waiting for \"sugar lumps\" to grow. - Personally I did not enjoy the \"minigames\" like garden or stock exchange. They're a frustrating combination of relying on luck whilst being forced to wait yet forced to pay attention.  TLDR: The main game is reasonable fun for a few \u00a3. Uninstall after getting all the building unlocks. Don't bother with \"sugar lumps\" or minigames.

Cookie Clicker is an addiction. Based on my extensive naturalistic observation, I have seen how far a person can and will go in order to keep clicking cookies. This behavior is very closely related to the behavior of addicts, supporting my statement about Cookie Clicker being an addiction.  Cookie Clicker is the only thing on the effected person's mind. Even during the short periods where Cookie Clicker is not being played, the addicted individual will talk about Cookie Clicker any chance they get. Unfortunately, many people I know have faced this horrible addiction and I have seen how it takes over their minds. One time, while I was helping an addicted child overcome his problem, another addicted man came and stole the conversation from me turning it into a twisted talk of obsession. There was another time that really stood out in my mind about how Cookie Clicker is always on the effected individual's mind. I was in the car with two addicted individuals and was trying to have a normal, healthy, conversation with one. Sadly, the other person interrupted the conversation to talk about his cookies, and in doing so, he ruined a game that me and the other addicted person have been playing for years. That was truly a soul crushing moment for me.  As the addiction gets worse, the effected person will forgo any form of healthy social interaction to feed his addiction. There have been many times where I would try to enjoy some social time with a person who is addicted to Cookie Clicker, but they will always choose the game over real people. Sometimes, although it is rare, they will participate in social activity, but their thoughts are quickly consumed by cookies and it shows in their choice of conversation.  Like any addiction, the Cookie Clicker addiction is damaging to those who care for the addicted individual. The addiction will cause those who care for the effected person to feel guilty. The addicted person's family may feel responsible for that person's addiction. They will question how they have allowed them to develop an addiction, or perhaps they fought hard to help the addicted individual but were not able to help. Regardless of the circumstances, those who are close to the addicted individual will carry guilt and blame themselves to a certain extent.  As I mentioned earlier, I know people that are effected by this horrid game. I have seen others try to explain to them how damaging a simple game could be but they refuse to listen, and to some extent, those people blame themselves for not trying hard enough and letting them get sucked into this dark place. Another way it could affect those around the effected person is by them downplaying the problem. Like any addiction, people close to the person could just live in denial about the effected person's problem. They might make excuses for the person's behavior or downplay the problem. They could also be scared about addressing the issue, worried about the possible future for the person, so they choose to ignore it instead of dealing with it.  At first I thought that this Cookie Clicker was a simple, although completely boring, game. Oh how wrong I was. The game slowly consumes the players, like a child eating cookies. I thought it was just going to be another game that people would quickly get bored of or forget about a few days later, and because of these thoughts, the Cookie Clicker addiction had time to fully manifest itself in their minds, since no one was trying to stop them. Another way it damages those around the addicted person, is that the addiction controls their mind. When people are addicted to something their whole life revolves around the addiction. It consumes their mind turning them into a different person, which is scary to those around them. Instead of the person seeing you as someone who cares for them, they will only see you as someone who is getting in the way of the only thing they care about, Cookie Clicker. You can try all you want to help the person get over this Cookie Clicker, but they won't see it that way. You could turn the computer off, but instead of the nice person you knew and cared for they will turn into some monster, screaming at you for making them lose their precious cookies. They are no longer the person you cared for.  Playing Cookie Clicker even just once is dangerous. Like any addictive thing, it may take only one time to become addicted. Cookie Clicker has just enough stuff for someone to keep on \"playing\" right from the beginning. At first you start with nothing, but as you continue clicking you gather enough cookies for upgrades, which make it so you can get more cookies faster, making you repeat an endless cycle of pain.  Cookie Clicker also has achievements for you to get, which keeps you hooked on the game. Not only does it have the upgrades that were mentioned earlier, but it also has achievements. Some of these achievement titles prove that the creators of the game are well aware that it's an addiction by having the achievement titles relate to drug use. One achievement is \"So baked right now\", another is \"Overdose\", and these sayings clearly show the relations to drug use.  Even if you manage to beat this addiction there is always the possibility of having a relapse. Unfortunately, no one I know has overcome this problem, but based on my knowledge of addictions, it's a very real possibility that they could suffer from a relapse. Relapses are a miserable part of addiction, even after you overcome the problem there is still a chance it could come back at any time. Possibly because of stress, negative emotions, really strong cravings, or being around things that remind you of Cookie Clicker. It is very damaging to your life and you might have to avoid cookies for the rest of your life unless you want to relapse. So you shouldn't play the game, even just once.  By now you should realize how dangerous this so called \"game\" is and the harmful effects it has on not only the player, but also those who care for the player. I truly hope that this paper will open people's eyes about this so called game, and that anyone who reads this won't let anyone they care for get sucked into this Cookie Clicker.", "Coming back from bingo and Granny's doing just fine, Gotta gotta bake now, cause I want it all.

It's what it says on the tin. It is an excellent clicker game, and you would be insane not to buy it if you enjoy those kinds of games.  Only qualm I have with it right now - It's quite badly optimised on steam and runs quite badly on my fairly decent pc (specs on my profile if you're curious). Which is surprising because I've played it before for days on a terrible, old laptop that struggled to play the Sims 2. So for now, until a hot-patch comes out that fixes this optimisation issue, I'm not recommending it and I'd suggest you go on the free web-page version of the game if your PC isn't the greatest - and then import your web browser save over to the steam version when it's fixed.   But this is definitely a limitation of the steam reviews, because I absolutely recommend this game - just maybe not QUITE in it's current state.  Edit for the game award badge.", "Before you flame this review to note that \"Clicker\" is literally right there in the name and I should have known better:  1) the game tags list \"Clicker\" and \"Idler\" as the top two tags 2) This genre as a whole tends to wrestle with how to appeal to both camps, often being better at one than the other.    As such, this is really a neutral review.  In short, Cookie Clicker is a good active clicker game, but not much of an idler.   Until your first ascension you won't gain any progress off-line, and even leaving the game running in the background, your progress will be significantly hampered both because of the need to buy upgrades and grandmas steadliy, but moreso because clicking Golden Cookies and later also wrinklers are a huge percentage of your revenue, and farms and towers will also require some regular attention. As a result it feels to me like the game doesn't really value strategy either, it really just values in-game time and clicking.  I'd say if you want a very active clicker game that you can dedicate a lot of time to paying attention to, Cookie Clicker does have a lot of charm (albeit the text flashes at the top get old very quickly) and a lot of bells and whistles to keep you clicking.  If you're wanting something you can really walk away from, and still feel like you're progressing, Cookie Clicker really isn't that game.

You actually to have be in the game for it to run.  Cons : - No offline gains. - Sometimes doesn't even run in the background, it stops accumulating cookies. - You have to always look at it to make sure it runs. - Takes too long to get to somewhere and it's not that fun.  Pros: - It's cheap.  That's just my opinion.", "yees", "Unpopular opinion: this isn't even close to being the best casual game on Steam, but people are acting as if it's the best game ever made, period. Simply ridiculous. This game lacks content, quickly gets boring, and they don't even give you full production while the game is off. This is a casual game, not competitive, right? Who cares if we get free cookies while we aren't playing?   There, I said it, and now I am going to be hacked, DDOS'd, flamed, tarred and feathered. Break out the pitchforks. Cancel culture me forever. I don't like Cookie Clicker.  P.S. Lazy Galaxy 1 is one example of a better title.

The user initially clicks on a big cookie on the screen, earning a single cookie per click. They can then spend their earned cookies upon purchasing assets such as \"cursors\" and other \"buildings\" that automatically produce cookies. Upgrades are also available and can improve the efficiency of clicks and buildings, among many other mechanics that allow the user to earn cookies in different ways. Though the game has no ending, it has hundreds of achievements, and users may aim to reach milestone numbers of cookies.  The game is one of the first and most important in the genre of incremental games and has a dedicated fanbase. Though the first version was coded in one night, Cookie Clicker is regularly updated. It has been widely described as addictive, and it has been noted that the game almost does not require a human to play it.  At first, the player clicks on the large cookie on the far left side of the screen, earning one cookie per click. With these cookies, the player can buy new assets such as cursors, grandmas, farms, mines, factories and banks that automatically make cookies. Prices increase exponentially, each asset costing 15% more than the last-purchased asset of the same type. Golden cookies, small cookies that appear in random locations and fade away after several seconds, appear periodically and grant effects, such as bonus cookies, or a temporary increase in the rate of production if clicked before they disappear.  After earning a certain number of cookies, the player can 'ascend', losing their progress but earning heavenly chips and prestige levels. Prestige levels add a permanent boost (+1% per level) to the rate of cookie production in future play-throughs, while heavenly chips can be spent on a wide variety of prestige upgrades. Note, however, that the cookies needed to unlock the next prestige level goes up exponentially with the cube of the level, becoming harder to attain as you get more of them. Other game mechanics include \"wrinklers\" (eldritch beasts which reduce cookie production, but can be popped by clicking on them, returning all the cookies it digested with interest), the Cookie Dragon, mini games, and sugar lumps (which take 24 hours to coalesce and are used to level up buildings and boost their production rate). Achievements can be earned by completing various tasks or goals, such as reaching a certain number of total cookies produced, owning a particular number of buildings of a certain type or clicking a certain number of golden cookies. Additionally, seasonal events occur during their respective holidays which come with more upgrades and cookies to unlock.  The game features geometric growth: the player begins baking handfuls of cookies, but can quickly reach billions of cookies, and eventually attain duodecillions of cookies or beyond. The game has no clear ending.  Because of the game's relatively simple code, cheats and add-ons are widely available and simply implemented by using browser consoles and bookmarklets.  Julien \"Orteil\" Thiennot created Cookie Clicker in August 2013. Written in a single evening, the game was posted in a link on 4chan, and garnered 50,000 players within hours. A month after the game's initial release, it had over 200,000 players per day. Orteil later wrote that traffic had peaked at 1.5 million hits in one day during August 2013, and as of January 2014 Cookie Clicker was still getting a steady 225,000 hits per day. The game has had continual updates since its release, notably the \"legacy\" update in February 2016 and the \"spiritual\" update in July 2017. On October 25, 2018, Orteil launched the game's Patreon page, with the intent to develop Cookie Clicker and other Dashnet games becoming a full-time job. On August 8, 2019, the mobile beta for Cookie Clicker was released for Android devices after a long delay.  Cookie Clicker is similar to Cow Clicker, a previously existing idle game created by Ian Bogost. Bogost has called Cookie Clicker \"the logical conclusion of Cow Clicker\". Orteil later released other idle games such as: Idle Game Maker, a tool allowing customized idle games to be made without coding knowledge; AdventureQuest Dragons, a mobile game created with Artix Entertainment; and Neverending Legacy.  Steam release On August 8, 2021, Orteil announced on Twitter a Steam release of Cookie Clicker, with the planned release date of September 1, 2021. The game was released on Steam on its originally announced release date. The release also consisted of a soundtrack composed by C418.", "Waste of time.", "Only 5$. Pretty straight forward. I never heard of the web browser version but many people talk about it. So it's actually a ported version of the web browser one with tons of achievements.   I was going to complain about the fact that there is no offline progression (when the game is closed) but doing some quick research, it's in fact something you have to unlock after you prestige. So it can be annoying at first when you don't have it because you literally can't progress if the game is not running. But I guess after that it's much easier. It's very interesting design. I like it!  Overall for the price, can only recommend it. I even bought it as a gift for my friend who is enjoying clicker and is an achievements hunter :P", "OG Clicker Game /10", "I was really looking forward to this game and was greatly disappointed. To say the game is confusing to play would be an understatement. Yes, games are all about discovery and trying things out and yada yada yada but this game just hides the main, core, game play mechanics behind vague descriptions in the hope that you will accidentally make the wrong choice and prolong the game play out another week in order to recover from your ill informed decision. If you play it, you will probably spend more time in the first 10 hours reading online guides that explain what to do than actually playing the game, and if you're reading a guide in the first 10 hours of the game rather than enjoying it is a major red flag (and those that say they didn't read a guide, well, you were lucky and made the right choices) .... this game might as well say 'hit this button, I'm not going to tell you what it does, but I have 50 other buttons that I'm not going to tell you what they do either so get used to it, oh, and here is like 12 choices, pick 3, but it's going to be impossible to work out if the 3 you choose are beneficial to you .. .have you tried reading a guide on the optimal choices\". This type of game play is incredibly frustrating. It shouldn't be like this for a game that you are just starting out playing. The game should be a lot more intuitive to the player experience. If you're literally going to invest hundreds of hours (like you need to in this game) it shouldn't be this hard. You shouldn't have a vague description over a selection that once you choose you have no idea what has happened....... so do you prestige at 1 heavenly chip after the first couple of hours of play, or 835 heavenly chips after leaving the game running for a week? Several online guides give different advice. the game though .. tells you nothing (oh sorry , it does,  it tells you you can do it at 1 .. but quick tip, don't do it after 1)", "1 billion cookies in and not a single one is real  ", "MMmm Cookie", "Just don't, it gets boring so fast it's not worth the time investment.", "This game saved my life.  I am 38.  My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.  When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.  After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.  Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my \"labor\". I relaxed for 5 \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.  After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.  Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.  I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.  Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.  Thank you.", ".

That's... almost 3 years, I think. But that's not why this review is negative. This review is negative because the game is too cheap, and Orteil deserves more. A game that's been entertaining people for years is definitely worth more. Now why are you looking at the bad reviews? Scroll up and buy this game! (I'm not saying to increase the price or anything like that, I'm saying they deserve more, and this means more attention and more people buying this great game, for all the fun it can give) edit: lmao check my time", "It is an idle game, which gets really old fast. Even with the simple mini \"games\" introduces later on does not really add much to it. Was a bit mislead by the trailer when expecting some sort of twist in the game.", "Okay, so after reading the positive reviews here I'm just wondering 'what am I missing' ?  After 70+ hours this game is  S  L  O  W. My 70+ hours have been spent using an auto-clicker, which would probably equal about 3 weeks if clicking manually, and I've prestiged once. That prestige made zero difference to the gameplay speed. I wasn't expecting to complete the game, but this is just ridiculous.  I'm a big fan of idle/clickers, so I'm not new to the genre, but if you try to play this mainly as an idler, instead of a clicker,  you will be playing this game for YEARS. Even that isn't necessarily a bad point, IF the game has things to do whilst your playing. This doesn't, it's slow AND boring. Can't recommend this game from what I've seen so far.", "Not epic", "na", "I would advise caution when looking at recommendations of this game, too often people are willing to give glowing reviews of a game, as if there is nothing that can be wrong with it, all for what amounts to favor with a developer and the future potential of special treatment in return, a simple concept only definable as corruption. This game could be great on here but I have to currently outright reject it for the following reasons:  1. The game just crashes only 1 minute after it loads up, the game goes white screen and i have no choice but to close it, music still playing. 2. When the game closes in this fashion, the process of said game remains, this comes off as amateurish at best. Regardless of my capabilities, it doesn't change it from being what it is. Additional Problem 3. When you fix the errors above by replacing the libGLESv2.dll with a new version you can download for free, the game will now instead just load up occasionally to a black screen. Maybe it's trying to load my gigantic save from browser versions, (since it's literally no different from it atm) but the game sorely lacks some kind of indicator of this.  I would advise that Orteil work on the above points, and I would also advise he remember to make sure his stuff works before charging money for it. I would also like to suggest that Point 2 be looked at as if it happens regardless of any game closure method, the process persisting comes off as sloppy, but that's just my opinion.  With the game in its current state I couldn't recommend this unless you literally paid me 2000 USD. If you buy this, don't be upset if it has the problems I mentioned, simply just ignore it exists and play the browser version, after all, a few aesthetic changes like music or graphics isn't going to improve a game to a degree that matters.  I may be harsh here, but the developer isn't new and I believe he can handle some harsh criticism. It feels like he isn't bringing his A-game for something he's charging money for now.", "sex", "lowered my hashrate from 26MH/s to 16MH/s ;( x", "click cookies mate  make grandma proud.", "amazing game i love it so much i played it multiple times", "cookie click click da cookie", "Very underwhelming.
